1
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,447
<i>[Woman] Miss Carmichael, please.</i>
<i>Dr. Petersen is ready for you.</i>

2
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:33,381
Awfully sorry I have to go.
Had a perfect hand.

3
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:36,544
- Would have beaten the pants off you.
- Harry will take you.

4
00:06:36,654 --> 00:06:38,918
- Oh, thank you.
- [Whispering] Watch her carefully.

5
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,389
Don't take your eyes off her.

6
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:49,897
- How are you today, Harry?
- Fine.

7
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,731
- You look a little bilious.
- It's the light.

8
00:06:52,837 --> 00:06:56,500
- I worry about you, dear.
- I'll be all right.

9
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:59,202
Must we dash
into Dr. Petersen's office?

10
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,144
Can't we go sit somewhere
in private and talk, just you and I?

11
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:05,147
Love it, if I had time.

12
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,683
Would you?
[Giggles]

13
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:11,118
[Gasps, Sighs]

14
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,885
<i>- [Doorbell Buzzes]</i>
- Come in.

15
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:25,099
You ruined a very interesting
card game, Dr. Petersen.

16
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:28,001
- You may go now, Harry.
- I'll be outside.

17
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,739
<i>- [Door Closes]</i>
- I hope you feel better today, Mary.

18
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:34,778
<i>- Well, I don't.</i>
- You will.

19
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,040
<i>I think this whole</i>
<i>thing is ridiculous.</i>

20
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:39,742
- What whole thing, Mary?
- Psychoanalysis.

21
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:41,944
It bores the pants off me.

22
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:45,682
Lying on the couch like some
dreary nitwit telling all.

23
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,523
You don't really expect to get
anywhere listening to me babble

24
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:53,597
- Really!
- My patients invariably regard me...

25
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:56,861
as a wretched nuisance
during our first talks.

26
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:59,903
I see. It's my subconscious
putting up a fight.

27
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:02,700
- It doesn't want me cured.
- Exactly.

28
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,241
It wants to continue
enjoying your disease.

29
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,903
Our job is to make you
understand why.

30
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:12,381
When you know why you're doing
something that's bad for you and

31
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:14,576
why, then you can begin
curing yourself.

32
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:17,553
- You mean I've been telling you lies.
- The usual proportion.

33
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:21,182
You're right.
I'm lying like mad.

34
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,590
I hate men.
I loathe them.

35
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:26,459
<i>If one of them</i>
<i>so much as touches me...</i>

36
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:29,032
I want to sink my teeth
into his hand and bite it off.

37
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,899
Hmm. In fact, I did that once.
Would you care to hear about it?

38
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:36,496
- Tell me anything you remember.
<i>- We were dancing.</i>

39
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,373
He kept asking me to marry him,
panting in my ear.

40
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,276
I suddenly pretended
I was going to kiss him.

41
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:45,815
I sank my teeth
into his moustache.

42
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:47,817
Bit it clear off.

43
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,989
You're laughing at me.

44
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:55,992
That smug, frozen face
of yours doesn't take me in.

45
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:59,222
You just want me to tell you all this
so you can feel superior to me.

46
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,731
You and your drooling science.
I detest you!

47
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,361
I never want to see that
nasty face of yours again!

48
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:10,407
<i>I can't bear you!</i>
<i>You and your nickel's worth of nothing!</i>

49
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,341
<i>[Sobbing]</i>

50
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,776
Come on, Miss Carmichael.

51
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,476
Silly fool. Letting a creature
like that worry me. Miss Frozen-puss.

52
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:24,885
Oh, Dr. Fleurot,
I want to talk to you alone.

53
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:27,583
I can't stand that woman.

54
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,354
- I'll see you later, Mary.
- Come, Miss Carmichael.

55
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,691
[Moans]

56
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:39,295
Murchison must be really out of his mind
to assign Carmichael to you.

57
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:42,531
You may report your findings
to the new head when he arrives.

58
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,339
You can't treat
a love veteran like Carmichael

59
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:51,074
I have done a great deal
of research on emotional problems

60
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:53,082
<i>Research, my eye!</i>

61
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:55,345
I've watched your work
for six months.

62
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:58,149
It's brilliant but lifeless.
There's no intuition in it.

63
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:01,555
You approach all your problems
with an ice pack on your head.

64
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:04,389
- Are you making love to me?
- I will in a moment.

65
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:06,929
I'm just clearing
the ground first.

66
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:10,398
I'm trying to convince you
that your lack of human

67
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:14,699
is bad for you as a doctor...
and fatal for you as a woman.

68
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:18,207
I've heard that argument from
a number of amorous psychiatrists...

69
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:20,777
who all wanted to make
a better doctor of me.

70
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:23,142
Ah, but I've got
a much better argument.

71
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,182
- I'm terribly fond of you.
- Why?

72
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,916
It's rather like
embracing a textbook.

73
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:36,016
- But why do you do it, then?
- Because you're not a textbook.

74
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:39,187
You're a sweet, pulsing,
adorable woman underneath.

75
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:41,595
I sense it every time
I come near to you.

76
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,963
You sense only your own
desires and pulsations.

77
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:46,400
I assure you, mine
in no way resemble them.

78
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:49,371
Stop it.
I'm mad about you.

79
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:56,340
I'm afraid I'm boring you.

80
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,610
No. Your attitudes
are very interesting.

81
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:02,242
I feel exactly
like Miss Carmichael.

82
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:05,447
I'd like to throw a book
at you... but I won't.

83
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:08,081
- May I borrow this?
- Certainly.

84
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,160
<i>Oh, and forgive me for my criticism.</i>

85
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:13,924
I think you'd better stick to books.
Oh, and another thing...

86
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:17,057
Pardon me for marching in,
but I'm spreading the tidings.

87
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:18,897
<i>My successor</i>
<i>will be due any moment.</i>

88
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:23,064
- Well, Dr. Murchison, it's been
a pleasure working under you.

89
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,074
<i>[Fleurot]</i>
<i>Coming, Dr. Petersen?</i>

90
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:27,337
Oh, I'm in no mad hurry
to welcome Dr. Edwardes.

91
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:32,741
<i>It's hard to imagine this place</i>
<i>without you, Dr. Murchison.</i>

92
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,750
Yes, I sort of go
with the fixtures.

93
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:37,753
More than that.
You are Green Manors. It seems unfair.

94
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,948
You're very young
in the profession.

95
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:42,321
You haven't learned
the basic secret of science.

96
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:44,656
The old must make way
for the new.

97
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:47,663
Particularly when the old is suspected
of a touch of senility.

98
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:51,257
Oh, that's ridiculous.
I should think the board would

99
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:53,428
You've been like a new man
since your vacation.

100
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:56,438
The board's as fair and all-knowing
as a hospital board can be.

101
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,338
Oh, I agree with you,
I'm as able and brilliant as ever.

102
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:02,344
But having crumbled once,
I might crumble again.

103
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:06,348
- You were overworked.
- A charming diagnosis

104
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,681
I shall always remember
your cheerfulness today...

105
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:12,688
as a lesson in how
to accept reality, Dr. Murchison.

106
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,384
Don't be too taken in
by my happy air, Constance.

107
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:19,020
It's the least difficult way
of saying good-bye to 20 years.

108
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,122
- Yes, l... I know. Come in.
<i>- [Doorbell Buzzes]</i>

109
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:26,169
Your mail, Dr. Petersen,
and Mr. Garmes.

110
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,795
<i>Come in, Mr. Garmes.</i>

111
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:31,500
You're not leaving today?
I'll see you again?

112
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:34,806
I shall hover around for a while
like an old mother hen.

113
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:38,348
At least until Dr. Edwardes
is firmly on the nest.

114
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,710
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

115
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:45,721
How do you feel today,
Mr. Garmes?

116
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:49,759
Somewhat better, Doctor. The thing
seems a little less troublesome.

117
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:54,595
May I do that for you, Doctor?

118
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:57,827
No, thank you. No, no.
I can do this myself very well.

119
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:00,836
Please sit down.
I'll be with you in a moment.

120
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:19,312
So that's the mighty
Anthony Edwardes.

121
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,857
He looks a little younger
than I expected.

122
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,019
He's only brought one suitcase. Perhaps
he doesn't intend to remain very long.

123
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:27,359
Leave those daydreams
to Dr. Murchison.

124
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:34,863
Gentlemen, our new chief,
Dr. Anthony Edwardes. Dr. Fleurot.

125
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:36,997
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

126
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,474
<i>- I am Dr. Graff.</i>
- How do you do?

127
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,477
<i>- Dr. Hanish.</i>
- How do you do?

128
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,673
There are still some staff
members missing, Dr. Edwardes.

129
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,182
These are your quarters.

130
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:51,284
They're very festive
for an institution.

131
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,881
<i>Dr. Edwardes, Dr. Murchison.</i>

132
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57,893
How do you do, Dr. Murchison?
I've heard a great deal about you, sir.

133
00:13:57,995 --> 00:14:01,431
And I, naturally, about you.
You're younger than I thought you'd be.

134
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:04,160
My age hasn't
caught up with me yet.

135
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:08,068
Mine has, it seems. I'm pleased to
hand over the reins to steadier hands.

136
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:12,006
I'm leaving you my library
which contains, amongst other

137
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:15,044
your latest volume,
<i>The Labyrinth of the Guilt Complex.</i>

138
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,707
An excellent work. I hope Green Manors
will inspire others as fine.

139
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,716
I'm very grateful.

140
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,912
I don't know the formal words
for an abdication, Dr. Edwardes.

141
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:29,482
May I say merely that these
quarters which I've occupied

142
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:31,584
Will you excuse me?

143
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,770
I spent a half hour
with Dr. Edwardes.

144
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:44,602
I must say, I was most
favorably impressed.

145
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,938
I intend to learn
a great deal from Dr. Edwardes.

146
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:49,740
I think we all can from a man
with such obvious talents.

147
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,577
- You're familiar with his work?
- Mm-hmm, yes. I've read all his books.

148
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,015
A very keen, unorthodox mind.

149
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:59,146
Well, it would be dreadful
if Dr. Murchison's successor

150
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:01,554
<i>He's joining us.</i>

151
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:11,390
<i>I think you know everyone here,</i>
<i>Dr. Edwardes.</i>

152
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:15,438
- No, not yet.
<i>- Oh, this is Dr. Petersen.</i>

153
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,441
- How do you do?
- Dr. Edwardes.

154
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:23,812
Dr. Hanish has been
showing me the grounds.

155
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:25,973
It's a remarkable
institution, Dr. Murchison.

156
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,176
It must be quite beautiful
in the summer.

157
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:32,278
I pointed out to Dr. Edwardes
our various open air diversions

158
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:36,291
Dr. Murchison always argued
we did not do enough in that

159
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,294
Let me warn you that Dr. Petersen
is a frustrated gymnast.

160
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,559
Well, Dr. Fleurot considers anything
beyond sitting and standing gymnastics.

161
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,827
I imagine you're
very fond of sports.

162
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:47,495
Yes, I am. And I miss them,
particularly winter sports.

163
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:50,199
- Did you show Dr. Edwardes
the elm grove?

164
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:53,037
Well, that's where we hope
to have our new swimming pool.

165
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:55,442
Oh, I'm a great believer
in the swimming pool.

166
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:57,844
There's a perfect spot
for it among the elms.

167
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:01,384
Not an oblong one,
but an irregular pool, something...

168
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:05,312
something like this.

169
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,552
<i>You know?</i>
<i>The bathhouse, it should be here...</i>

170
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:15,891
I take it that the supply of linen
at this institution is inexhaustible.

171
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:23,530
[Sighs]
Forgive me.

172
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:28,044
Oh, that reminds me of my
professor in psychiatry, Dr. Brulov.

173
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:31,512
He could never stand a sauce bottle
on the table, or even a salt shaker.

174
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,049
They took his appetite away.

175
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:37,545
I remember once
at a banquet in his honor...

176
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:40,681
<i>he refused to sit</i>
<i>at the speaker's table...</i>

177
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,090
<i>because he was</i>
<i>completely surrounded by...</i>

178
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:46,095
by ketchup.

179
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:57,398
Last night at dinner,
a dimple appeared at your cheek

180
00:16:57,508 --> 00:17:01,342
and I detected the outcroppings of
a mother instinct toward Dr. Edwardes.

181
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:04,107
I detest that sort
of high school talk.

182
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:07,446
Your reactions have upset
one of my pet theories about you.

183
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:10,349
To wit, that you were immune
to psychoanalysts...

184
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:13,514
and would end up in the arms
of some Boob McNutt with spiked hair.

185
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:18,084
If I were looking for that type,
Dr. Fleurot, I would long ago

186
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:21,028
<i>- [Doorbell Buzzes]</i>
- Come in.

187
00:17:21,131 --> 00:17:24,328
Hi... Oh, excuse me.

188
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:27,131
It's from Dr. Edwardes.

189
00:17:27,238 --> 00:17:30,139
Ohhh, love notes already.

190
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:33,142
<i>The French school of science.</i>

191
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:40,244
I didn't want to come to this
institution, but my brother insisted.

192
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,615
I can see
no sense in it myself.

193
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,951
You see, I'm convinced I'm not
suffering from any hallucination...

194
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:48,115
but that my guilt is very real.

195
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:51,251
I know, Dr. Edwardes,
that I killed my father...

196
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,126
- and I'm willing
to pay the penalty for...

197
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:56,563
<i>[Edwardes]</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

198
00:17:56,667 --> 00:18:00,000
<i>Oh, thank you</i>
<i>for coming so soon.</i>

199
00:18:00,104 --> 00:18:03,335
<i>I've been listening to Mr. Garmes</i>
<i>and thought you might help me out.</i>

200
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,136
Oh, Mr. Garmes, you shouldn't
have disturbed Dr. Edwardes.

201
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:08,677
Oh, it's all right. I'm very
interested in Mr. Garmes' case.

202
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:12,146
Yes, I knew you would be.
He fits perfectly into your

203
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:14,683
Would you mind telling me
what you're talking about?

204
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:18,812
You're here to see if
we can cure your guilt complex

205
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:23,484
But I have no guilt complex.
I know what I know.

206
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:26,859
- I killed my father, and l...
- No, you didn't kill your father.

207
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:29,933
That's a misconception
that has taken hold of you.

208
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:33,162
Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor.
You were talking to him.

209
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,704
No, no. Go on.

210
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:41,169
People often feel guilty
over something they never did.

211
00:18:41,278 --> 00:18:43,337
It usually goes back
to their childhood.

212
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:46,507
A child often wishes something
terrible would happen to someone.

213
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:48,847
And if something does
happen to that person...

214
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:51,011
the child believes
he has caused it.

215
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:53,112
<i>And he grows up</i>
<i>with a guilt complex...</i>

216
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:55,350
<i>over a sin that was</i>
<i>only a child's bad dream.</i>

217
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:58,257
What I am thinking
isn't true, then.

218
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:02,321
No. And in the course of analyzing
yourself, you will see that.

219
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,630
Would you care to go back
to your room, Mr. Garmes?

220
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:12,139
<i>- [Door Opens]</i>
<i>- Harry.</i>

221
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:18,110
I think we'd better put him
under drugs for a few days.

222
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:20,206
He looks agitated.

223
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:22,410
His conviction is curious.

224
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,420
But you've encountered such cases
very often, Dr. Edwardes.

225
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:28,889
You described them
perfectly in your book.

226
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:32,428
Yes. Yes, so I did.

227
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,734
- Uh, would you mind doing me a favor?
- Not at all, Doctor.

228
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:41,100
I have a headache, and I'd like to take
the afternoon off... with you.

229
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:43,901
I understand you're not
on duty till after dinner.

230
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,032
Well, I intended
typing up my notes...

231
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,771
Oh, please. I need a little fresh air,
and it might do you a bit of good.

232
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:52,212
I was going to lunch with Dr. Hanish.
He has an interesting kleptomaniac...

233
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,444
Oh, kleptomaniacs for lunch. They'll
steal the food right out of your mouth.

234
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:58,248
- [Phone Ringing]
- Excuse me.

235
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:02,018
Hello.
Yes, Dr. Edwardes.

236
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:05,721
What?
Yes, Anthony Edwardes.

237
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,356
Who? I'm sorry.
I don't get your name.

238
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,868
Norma Cramer.

239
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:18,333
Please, Miss Cramer,
I'm very busy and I don't know you.

240
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,678
Some girl claiming to be...

241
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:27,681
[Chuckles]
I hate practical jokes. Don't you?

242
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:30,583
People calling you up
and chirping, "Guess who I am."

243
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,780
Sounds like some
ex-patient of yours.

244
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,790
They are always full
of coy little tricks.

245
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:36,792
Very likely.
Come on, let's go.

246
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:40,796
We'll look at some sane trees, normal
grass and clouds without complexes.

247
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:42,957
[Laughs]

248
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:50,300
I think the greatest harm done the
human race has been done by the poets.

249
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:54,343
Oh, poets are dull boys, most of them,
but not especially fiendish.

250
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:57,243
They keep filling people's heads
with delusions about love...

251
00:20:57,347 --> 00:21:00,578
writing about it as if
it were a symphony orchestra

252
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:03,278
Which it isn't, eh?

253
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,288
Of course not.
People fall in love, as they put it...

254
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,188
because they respond
to a certain hair coloring...

255
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:12,387
or vocal tones or mannerisms
that remind them of their parents.

256
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:15,522
- Sometimes for no reason at all.
<i>- That's not the point.</i>

257
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:19,966
The point is that people
read about love as one thing

258
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,597
Well, they expect kisses
to be like lyrical poems...

259
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:26,870
and embraces to be
like Shakespearean dramas.

260
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:29,411
And when they find out
differently...

261
00:21:29,513 --> 00:21:33,472
then they get sick and
have to be analyzed, eh?

262
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,179
- Yes, very often.
- Professor, you're suffering

263
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:40,347
I beg your pardon!
[Laughs]

264
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:42,857
Here, can't get
through there like that.

265
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,861
Of course I can. Really.
I've been through here many times.

266
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:48,022
- Oh!
- Whoops. Hurt?

267
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:50,031
- No, not at all.
- Here.

268
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,192
No, I'm perfectly all right.
[Laughs]

269
00:21:52,302 --> 00:21:54,827
Well, I usually
go on picnics here alone.

270
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,202
Oh, that doesn't
sound like much fun.

271
00:21:57,307 --> 00:21:59,571
I haven't gone in for fun,
as you call it.

272
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:02,668
Oh, isn't this beautiful?

273
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,679
Perfect.

274
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:08,151
Oh, lunch, lunch.
What'll you have?

275
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:10,152
Ham or liverwurst, hmm?

276
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:14,089
Liverwurst.

277
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:19,056
Has anybody seen
our new chief today?

278
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:21,392
He has been tied up.

279
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:24,763
He frisked off
with Dr. Petersen at noon.

280
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:29,271
It's odd, spending his first day
running after Dr. Petersen

281
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:31,807
It'll do Constance good
to be drooled over.

282
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:34,070
Poor girl's withering away
with science.

283
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:37,840
I was telling her only recently
that something vital was missing

284
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:39,848
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

285
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:48,754
Oh, please don't get up.
I just came in because I learned

286
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:51,657
- Yes, I gave him a sedative.
- I'm very sorry I wasn't here.

287
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:55,425
- Constance, you look as if
you had an instructive time.

288
00:22:55,532 --> 00:22:58,990
Gentlemen, notice her stocking.
The lady's been climbing trees.

289
00:22:59,102 --> 00:23:01,070
Or lolling in a briar patch.

290
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,106
No, no, it's trees.
There are two leaves in her hair.

291
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:06,607
Allow me, Dr. Petersen.

292
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,679
You're surpassing yourself
as a charmer, Dr. Fleurot.

293
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,146
Don't run away.
Do have some coffee.

<i>[Fleurot]</i>
<i>Oh, Dr. Petersen has already eaten...</i>

00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:19,752
I would say hot dogs
on the state highway.

297
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:23,917
Would you really? Your diagnosis
is, as usual, wrong, Dr. Fleurot.

298
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:27,793
Not hot dogs. Liverwurst. I'm very
sorry I have to leave this nursery.

299
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:31,129
- I must see Mr. Garmes.
<i>- [Door Opens, Closes]</i>

300
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:34,795
Looks as if we have Casanova himself
at the head of Green Manors.

301
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:37,567
Did you notice her blush every
time we mentioned his name?

302
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:15,583
It's very late.

303
00:27:21,064 --> 00:27:23,464
L-I was going to read
your new book again.

304
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:27,298
I would like to discuss it.
I have never discussed

305
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:32,068
Of course, at school we had
several literary professors,

306
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:36,202
I sound rather nervous,
don't I?

307
00:27:36,313 --> 00:27:37,780
Not at all.

308
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:44,616
I thought I wanted
to discuss your book with you.

309
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:47,281
I am amazed
at the subterfuge.

310
00:27:49,492 --> 00:27:51,653
I don't want
to discuss it at all.

311
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:54,127
I understand.

312
00:27:54,231 --> 00:27:59,134
It's quite remarkable to discover that
one isn't what one thought one was.

313
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:03,366
I mean, I've always been entirely
aware of what was in my mind.

314
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,169
And you're not now?

315
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,974
[Sighs]
Quite ridiculous.

316
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:16,849
It was stupid of me to come
in here like a distracted child.

317
00:28:16,953 --> 00:28:20,548
- You're very lovely.
- Please don't talk that way.

318
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,353
You'll think I came in
to hear that.

319
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:29,825
- I know why you came in.
- Why?

320
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:32,595
Because something
has happened to us.

321
00:28:32,702 --> 00:28:37,605
But it doesn't happen
like that, in a day.

322
00:28:37,707 --> 00:28:40,608
It happens in a moment,
sometimes.

323
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,110
I felt it this afternoon.

324
00:28:43,213 --> 00:28:46,046
It was like lightning striking.

325
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,082
It strikes rarely.

326
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:26,282
I don't understand
how it happened.

327
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:43,171
- What is it?
- It's not you.

328
00:29:43,273 --> 00:29:45,741
It's something
about your robe.

329
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:48,640
My robe?
I don't understand.

330
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,377
Forgive me. L...
Something struck me.

331
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:56,384
I've been having a rather
bad time with my nerves lately.

332
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:59,182
Your robe...
I mean, the dark lines.

333
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:01,382
- You're ill.
<i>- [Phone Ringing]</i>

334
00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:03,857
No, I'll be all right.

335
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:09,655
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Yes, Dr. Edwardes.</i>

336
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,927
<i>Yes. Yes. What?</i>

337
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:14,833
<i>Where is he?</i>
<i>I'll be there right away.</i>

338
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,169
Mr. Garmes. He's run amuck.
He tried to murder Fleurot,

339
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,708
- Well, is it bad?
- I think so. He's in surgery.

340
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,937
I'll be right along.

341
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:32,012
He's lost a lot of blood,
but I think he'll pull through.

342
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,716
- What's the pulse?
- One hundred and forty.

343
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:36,951
It's going down.

344
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:00,205
Why are the lights out
in the corridor?

345
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,581
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
- It's dark.

346
00:31:03,686 --> 00:31:06,587
That's why he did it!
'Cause the lights are out!

347
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:08,589
Put 'em on!

348
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:10,716
The doors.
Unlock them!

349
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,227
- You can't keep people in cells!
- Dr. Edwardes.

350
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,923
You fools, babbling
about guilt complexes.

351
00:31:16,032 --> 00:31:18,193
What do you know about them?

352
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:22,863
He did it. He told me.
He killed his father.

353
00:31:22,972 --> 00:31:27,409
[Panting]
Put the lights on, quick!

354
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,411
<i>It's dark. It's dark.</i>

355
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,311
- He's in collapse.
- He's ill.

356
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:37,716
- He didn't look like a heart case.
- Not heart, shock of some sort.

357
00:31:37,821 --> 00:31:39,846
- We must get...
- Probably brought about by exhaustion.

358
00:31:39,956 --> 00:31:42,481
Take him up to his room.
I'll take care of him.

359
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:48,389
I'm sorry.

360
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:53,457
I suppose I made
quite an exhibition of myself.

361
00:32:57,367 --> 00:33:01,098
Who brought me down here?
You?

362
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:09,037
It's rather a mess.
Going to pieces in surgery.

363
00:33:11,648 --> 00:33:13,582
Who are you?

364
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:28,426
I remember now.

365
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:30,795
Edwardes is dead.

366
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:35,399
I killed him
and took his place.

367
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:39,367
I'm someone else.
I don't know who.

368
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,377
I killed him. Edwardes.

369
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:56,491
I have no memory.

370
00:33:56,593 --> 00:34:00,085
It's like looking into a mirror
and seeing nothing but the mirror.

371
00:34:00,196 --> 00:34:02,721
And yet the image is there.
I know it's there.

372
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,096
I exist. I'm there.

373
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:07,567
How can a man lose
his memory, his name...

374
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,264
everything he's ever known
and still talk like this?

375
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:14,309
As if he were quite sane.
Are you afraid of me?

376
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:19,507
No. You're ill. Loss of memory
is not a difficult problem.

377
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:22,141
Yes, I know. Amnesia.

378
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:25,619
A trick of the mind
for remaining sane.

379
00:34:25,722 --> 00:34:29,419
You remain sane by forgetting
something too horrible to remember.

380
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,959
You put the horrible thing
behind a closed door.

381
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:34,996
- We have to open that door.
- I know what's behind that door:

382
00:34:35,098 --> 00:34:39,000
No. That's a delusion you
have acquired out of illness.

383
00:34:39,102 --> 00:34:42,196
Will you answer me truthfully
and trust me?

384
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:45,103
I trust you, but it's no use.
I can't think.

385
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,803
I don't know who I am.
I don't know. I don't know.

386
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:52,870
- Who telephoned you yesterday?
<i>- Telephoned me?</i>

387
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:55,644
Yes, there in the office.

388
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:57,652
<i>Yes, I remember.</i>

389
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:01,454
What did she say?

390
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,754
She said that she was
my office assistant.

391
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:07,022
She was worried
about me, hadn't heard...

392
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,826
You mean, she was Dr. Edwardes'
assistant and hadn't heard from him?

393
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:11,832
What else did she say?

394
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:14,869
She didn't recognize my voice.
That I wasn't Dr. Edwardes.

395
00:35:14,971 --> 00:35:19,431
- You hung up in anger?
- I was confused. My... My head ached.

396
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:22,033
- Was that your first doubt?
- First doubt?

397
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:25,205
The first time you became
confused as Edwardes?

398
00:35:25,315 --> 00:35:28,182
Did anything else happen
before that?

399
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,653
Yes.

400
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:34,951
While I was in the hotel room
packing to come here...

401
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:37,549
I found a cigarette case
in my coat.

402
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,493
It frightened me.
I didn't know why it should.

403
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,496
Here.

404
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:48,198
The initials "J.B."
See them?

405
00:35:48,304 --> 00:35:51,535
- Yes.
- When I saw them in the hotel room...

406
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:54,303
they made my head ache.

407
00:35:57,513 --> 00:36:00,414
They're probably
your initials.

408
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:04,848
J.B. J.B.

409
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:15,059
You must sleep. I think when you wake
up, you'll be able to tell me more.

410
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:18,099
- If you trust me.
- I trust you.

411
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:21,102
It's late. You'd better
get some sleep yourself.

412
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:23,604
I'll be all right.

413
00:36:27,543 --> 00:36:30,944
I'm-I'm sure there will be no
police inquiry for a few days...

414
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:34,915
and we'll talk about it and straighten
everything up before anything happens.

415
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:43,257
I'll come in in the morning and
report you're too ill for service.

416
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,554
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

417
00:37:30,907 --> 00:37:34,001
I have been in Dr. Edwardes'
office for five years...

418
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,307
and the man who spoke to me
is not Dr. Edwardes.

419
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:40,280
He let me have my vacation
when he left on his.

420
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,546
I was very worried when I didn't
hear from him last week.

421
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:47,589
Then I thought he might have just
come here without reopening his office.

422
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,386
- That's why I telephoned.
- Show them the picture.

423
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:52,393
Oh, yes.

424
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:03,504
That's a different man.

425
00:38:03,606 --> 00:38:07,098
He was taking a chance. Somebody might
have known what Edwardes looked like.

426
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,873
- You never saw the real Edwardes?
- No, I never met him.

427
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,007
But I felt something was wrong
from the moment our man appeared.

428
00:38:15,117 --> 00:38:17,711
He didn't impress me
as a scientist.

429
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,415
And last night when he collapsed,
I became actually alarmed.

430
00:38:21,524 --> 00:38:24,220
What do you think made him
break down last night?

431
00:38:24,327 --> 00:38:26,693
It's obvious now... Garmes.

432
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:30,698
Our impostor, I'm almost certain,
is an amnesia case.

433
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,667
Garmes brought him back
to reality for an instant.

434
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,966
And being unable to face the truth
of who he was, he collapsed.

435
00:38:37,073 --> 00:38:39,940
- You think he may have killed Edwardes?
- There's no question of it.

436
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:44,240
He killed Dr. Edwardes and took his
place in order to conceal his crime...

437
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:47,282
by pretending
the victim was still alive.

438
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:50,409
This sort of unrealistic act
is typical...

439
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,047
of the shortsighted cunning
that goes with paranoid behavior.

440
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:57,683
But we're wasting time, gentlemen.
His room is upstairs.

What has happened?

447
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,753
Nothing to be alarmed about.
Our Dr. Edwardes turns out to be

448
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:32,191
<i>and is very likely guilty</i>
<i>of having murdered the real Edwardes.</i>

449
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:36,391
<i>- He's disappeared.</i>
- Oh. He is not in his room?

450
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,797
You left him
in his room, miss?

451
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:41,461
- Yes.
- Did he say anything?

452
00:39:41,571 --> 00:39:43,539
About himself?
About why he broke down?

453
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,302
No. He was not himself.
He was unable to speak coherently.

454
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,174
You don't seem very surprised
to learn that this Dr. Edwardes...

455
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:53,305
is a fake
and may be guilty of murder.

456
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:55,213
L-I'm used to such surprises
in my work.

457
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:58,151
You suspected something, then?

458
00:39:58,254 --> 00:40:01,417
No. I thought his collapse
due to a mental strain.

459
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:06,257
That's a funny diagnosis for a fellow
who's supposed to have just come

460
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,162
I made no medical diagnosis.
I was shocked to see him collapse,

461
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:13,667
We were all pretty shocked, Sheriff.
The fellow took us all in.

462
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:16,602
All except Dr. Murchison.

463
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:20,107
And he didn't say anything that might
give you an idea of where he went?

464
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,109
<i>No.</i>

465
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,544
He may be hanging around. We'll
have to go over the grounds first.

466
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:34,851
I'm sorry this has happened
to you, Constance.

467
00:40:34,957 --> 00:40:38,017
I felt like warning you
about him, but I wasn't certain.

468
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:40,322
Don't worry.
It's not your fault.

469
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:43,956
They're bound to find him. I'll keep
you informed of the police activities.

470
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:11,182
I say the fellow expected
to get away with it, like any criminal.

471
00:41:11,293 --> 00:41:13,454
Nonsense. Obviously
a case of amnesia.

472
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:16,690
He hadn't the faintest notion
of who he was or what he was doing.

473
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,790
What do you say, Constance?

474
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:20,801
I, I don't know.

475
00:41:20,903 --> 00:41:23,394
You know, if you were anybody
but Constance Petersen...

476
00:41:23,506 --> 00:41:25,974
the human glacier
and the custodian of truth...

477
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:28,373
- I'd say...
- Yes, you'd say what?

478
00:41:28,477 --> 00:41:31,537
My dear, forgive me my scurvy thoughts.
You are telling the truth.

479
00:41:31,647 --> 00:41:34,309
I was going to say that
you were holding something back.

480
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,783
I'm a sentimental ass.
A woman like you...

481
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:40,219
could never become involved emotionally
with any man, sane or insane.

482
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:42,313
I suggest you change
the subject, Fleurot.

483
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:45,155
I will be very interested
to ask him certain questions...

484
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:48,162
when they bring him back here,
no matter what you think.

485
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:51,290
- You'll never ask our
mystery man any questions.

486
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,426
For the very good reason
the police will never find him alive.

487
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:58,029
<i>Amnesia case of that sort</i>
<i>with the police after him...</i>

488
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,041
<i>Fellow will put an end to his</i>
<i>pain, nightmare fantasies...</i>

489
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:04,601
<i>either by blowing his brains out</i>
<i>or dropping himself out of a window.</i>

490
00:42:04,714 --> 00:42:07,615
You're offending Dr. Petersen
with your callousness.

491
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:11,881
I'm sorry, Constance, that our
staff still retains the manners

492
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,787
Why, I'm not offended. I think
Dr. Fleurot's ideas are quite accurate.

493
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:19,383
But I'm rather tired.
Good night. Good night.

494
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:23,293
[Radio Newscaster]
The police have asked me to announce...

495
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:28,098
that our neighborhood roads
are free of the dangerous madman

496
00:42:28,204 --> 00:42:31,139
The search for the impostor
has shifted to Manhattan.

497
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,835
This is WQZK, Rutland,
George Bell.

498
00:42:34,944 --> 00:42:38,072
[Announcer] We now resume
our regularly scheduled program.

[Sighs]

501
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,437
Sure feels good to take
the weight off your feet.

502
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,444
I'm from Pittsburgh.

503
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:48,915
There's a town for you.

504
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:52,249
Really can meet people
in Pittsburgh.

505
00:43:52,354 --> 00:43:54,720
Friendly.

506
00:43:54,824 --> 00:43:59,318
A fellow could live and die in this
town, and he couldn't meet nobody.

507
00:44:01,831 --> 00:44:06,393
How about you and me having
a nice little drink together

508
00:44:06,502 --> 00:44:08,732
No, thank you. L...

509
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:11,773
You don't have to be
so snooty about it.

510
00:44:11,874 --> 00:44:16,743
I'll have you know, madam, that I know
better people than you in Pittsburgh.

511
00:44:16,846 --> 00:44:20,873
Yeah, I'm sure you're a great
social success, given half a chance.

512
00:44:20,983 --> 00:44:23,281
Now you're talkin'.

513
00:44:23,385 --> 00:44:26,183
Do you mind not sitting
in my lap in public?

514
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:30,019
<i>That's enough of that.</i>
<i>Beat it.</i>

515
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:34,562
I'll have you know I'm a guest in this
hotel. Who do you think you are?

516
00:44:34,663 --> 00:44:38,121
I'm the house detective.
Get going.

517
00:44:39,735 --> 00:44:42,431
<i>Aw, this town's</i>
<i>gettin' worse and worse.</i>

518
00:44:44,206 --> 00:44:47,107
Oh, that's all right, lady.
You don't have to go.

519
00:44:47,209 --> 00:44:49,200
I'm sorry
you were being annoyed.

520
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,405
I've been watching you, and I figured
something like this might happen.

521
00:44:52,514 --> 00:44:54,914
See, the chief duty
of a house detective...

522
00:44:55,017 --> 00:44:57,451
is to spot trouble in advance.

523
00:44:57,553 --> 00:44:59,783
- You're not registered here, are you?
- No.

524
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:03,222
Well, I didn't think so,
the way you were wandering around.

525
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,522
Lookin' for somebody, huh?
Oh, now, don't be afraid of me.

526
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:10,292
I, uh, I've got you spotted
as a lady in trouble...

527
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:12,560
and from out of town.

528
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,762
Schoolteacher
or, uh, librarian.

529
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:18,499
<i>- Which is it?</i>
- Schoolteacher.

530
00:45:18,607 --> 00:45:22,475
I thought so. They always look
like they just lost something.

531
00:45:22,578 --> 00:45:25,376
- Maybe I can help you.
- I don't think so. Thank you.

532
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:27,415
<i>Looking for some man, I suppose.</i>

533
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,007
Must be a relative.

534
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:33,088
And from the worried look,
I'd say a pretty close one.

535
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,748
A husband, for instance.

536
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,190
Oh, I'm really amazed.

537
00:45:38,294 --> 00:45:40,854
- I hit it, huh?
- But how could you tell?

538
00:45:40,963 --> 00:45:43,397
Well, I'm a kind of a psychologist.

539
00:45:43,499 --> 00:45:45,626
You know, you gotta be in my line.

540
00:45:46,735 --> 00:45:49,932
Now would you mind filling in
a few of the blank spaces for me?

541
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,066
Oh, no.
It's just that we quarreled.

542
00:45:54,176 --> 00:45:57,304
<i>Oh, and then you got sorry</i>
<i>and you came running after him?</i>

543
00:45:57,413 --> 00:45:59,711
That's the usual psychology.

544
00:45:59,815 --> 00:46:01,942
But now you're afraid to face him.

545
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,519
Oh, no, no.

546
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,350
It's that l...
I don't know what room he's in.

547
00:46:07,456 --> 00:46:10,016
He told a friend
he was coming to this hotel...

548
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:12,855
but under a different name
so I couldn't find him.

549
00:46:12,962 --> 00:46:15,988
But I must find him and apologize
and make him feel better.

550
00:46:16,098 --> 00:46:18,726
When did he arrive here?

551
00:46:20,202 --> 00:46:22,102
Yesterday morning.

552
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:24,263
<i>Give me a description of him.</i>

553
00:46:24,373 --> 00:46:27,934
He's-He's very tall
and, and attractive.

554
00:46:28,043 --> 00:46:32,207
Uh, dark hair,
a rather rugged face...

555
00:46:32,314 --> 00:46:35,750
and brown eyes and one suitcase.

556
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:39,184
I'll go check on him.

557
00:46:59,575 --> 00:47:01,839
[Sighs]

558
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:16,984
- Did you find him?
- Well, I think we got a line.

559
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:20,459
About 25 guys answering your
description registered here yesterday.

560
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:22,496
These are their
registration cards.

561
00:47:22,598 --> 00:47:24,896
I figured you might
recognize the handwriting.

562
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,400
That's very clever of you.

563
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:37,441
This is his handwriting.

564
00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:40,913
John Brown, huh?
Not much imagination for an alias.

565
00:47:41,016 --> 00:47:43,280
- Room 3033.
- Oh, thank you very much.

566
00:47:43,385 --> 00:47:46,479
- I was going to sit here
all day watching for him.

567
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:49,216
I'm glad to be of service.
I'm a married man myself...

568
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:53,124
and I know how it feels to have a wife
come chasing after you to apologize.

What did you come for?
You don't owe me anything.

572
00:48:11,713 --> 00:48:14,705
I'm going to do
what I want to do.

573
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:17,980
Take care of you and cure you
and remain with you till that happens.

574
00:48:18,087 --> 00:48:20,715
But you can't.
You can't help hide a criminal.

575

You're not going to jeopardize
your standing as a doctor.

You're just getting started.
I won't let you be stupid about it.

00:48:26,762 --> 00:48:28,821
I couldn't bear it away from you.

578
00:48:28,931 --> 00:48:32,094
I went through yesterday holding
my breath as if I were being hunted.

579
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:35,568
I couldn't eat or work
or do anything but think of you.

580
00:48:35,671 --> 00:48:39,402
So I had to come.
I'll get a room on this floor.

Nothing at all.

Let your mind go back

Was it happy?
Whom did you know in your childhood?

- It's no use.
- You lived somewhere.

588
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:18,537
You had a mother.
You were loved. You had friends.

589
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:21,309
Yes. Probably a wife.

590
00:49:24,486 --> 00:49:26,613
Can you remember her?

591
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:31,591
Oh, I didn't say I had one.
I said I probably had.

No, darling. Thank heaven
I can't remember a wife.

00:49:43,705 --> 00:49:46,674
It mixes me up. L...

596
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:50,404
I can't remember anything...
except that I love you.

597
00:49:50,512 --> 00:49:53,447
How would you diagnose a pain
in the right upper quadrant?

598
00:49:53,549 --> 00:49:55,642
A pain that is persistent.

599
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:59,585
Oh, a gall bladder, possibly
a heart case or pneumonia...

600
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:03,419
- depending on the patient's history.
- It's obvious you're a doctor.

601
00:50:03,525 --> 00:50:07,859
Yes. The eminent Dr. X.

602
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,329
And if we can unlock
one tiny memory...

603
00:50:10,432 --> 00:50:12,866
it'll give us a key
to the others.

604
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,368
No.

605
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,802
The only thing
that comes to my mind...

606
00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:20,670
that I keep thinking over and over,
is the logic of the situation.

607
00:50:20,776 --> 00:50:24,371
- What logic?
- That it was I who was with Edwardes.

608
00:50:27,216 --> 00:50:30,982
"Police believe the impostor
who escaped from Green Manors...

609
00:50:31,086 --> 00:50:34,180
to be the patient who visited
the real Dr. Edwardes...

610
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:38,521
in the Cumberland Mountains the day
that the noted psychiatrist disappeared.

611
00:50:38,627 --> 00:50:41,255
No trace of Dr. Edwardes
has been found...

612
00:50:41,363 --> 00:50:44,730
since he left the Cumberland resort
in the company of his supposed patient."

613
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,824
- Do you remember that?
- No.

614
00:50:46,935 --> 00:50:49,597
Then why do you believe
that you were with him?

615
00:50:49,705 --> 00:50:52,731
Because wherever we went,
I came back with his identity.

616
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:56,743
I wouldn't have come back
as Dr. Edwardes if I hadn't

617
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,508
How would I have known
he was dead if I hadn't been

618
00:51:00,616 --> 00:51:02,914
- Were you?
- I, I don't remember, but...

619
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:07,387
logically I know
that I must have been.

620
00:51:09,124 --> 00:51:13,458
And logically I also know
why the body hasn't been found.

621
00:51:13,562 --> 00:51:16,292
Because it was hidden by me.

622
00:51:17,899 --> 00:51:19,992
Don't you see that
you're imagining all this?

623
00:51:20,102 --> 00:51:24,402
You call yourself names. You insist
without proof that you're a murderer.

624
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:26,940
You know what that is,
don't you?

625
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:30,068
Whoever you are, it's a guilt complex
that speaks for you.

626
00:51:30,178 --> 00:51:32,874
A guilt fantasy that goes
way back to your childhood.

627
00:51:32,981 --> 00:51:37,350
I think you're quite mad.
You're much crazier than I.

628
00:51:37,452 --> 00:51:40,683
Do all this for a creature
without a name.

629
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:44,316
To run off
with a pair of initials.

630
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:53,067
The police have not given your name
or case history to the papers.

631
00:51:53,168 --> 00:51:55,295
That must mean only one thing...

632
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:58,771
that your name was not
in Dr. Edwardes' files.

633
00:51:58,874 --> 00:52:00,774
You were in an accident.

634
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,977
<i>Where was it?</i>

635
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,606
<i>What happened to your hand?</i>
<i>Your hand was burned.</i>

636
00:52:07,716 --> 00:52:10,810
You've had an operation
in the last six months.

637
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,854
And skin grafts.
Third-degree burns.

638
00:52:13,955 --> 00:52:17,015
Your hand was burned.
Where?

639
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:19,753
- It hurts.
<i>- Try remembering.</i>

640
00:52:19,861 --> 00:52:22,762
[Panting]
My hand hurts.

641
00:52:22,864 --> 00:52:26,595
Your hand is remembering.
Open your mind, and the pain will leave.

642
00:52:26,702 --> 00:52:28,932
- Where did it happen?
- I can't. It hurts.

643
00:52:29,037 --> 00:52:31,562
- What happened?
- It's burning. My hand's burning.

644
00:52:31,673 --> 00:52:33,573
Try to remember.

645
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:44,410
Oh, my dear,
are you all right?

646
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:46,612
I'm all right.
What happened?

647
00:52:46,722 --> 00:52:49,623
You relived an accident
you've been in.

648
00:52:49,725 --> 00:52:52,956
But the memory only touched
the part of your mind that feels.

649
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:55,859
But it's a beginning.
It really is.

650
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,297
- You'll feel better soon.
<i>- [Doorbell Buzzes]</i>

651
00:52:59,401 --> 00:53:01,995
- Who could that be?
- Oh, I know.

652
00:53:02,104 --> 00:53:05,039
I sent out for the later
editions of the papers.

653
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:10,844
- You ordered the afternoon
papers, didn't you?

654
00:53:10,946 --> 00:53:13,813
- They just came.
I brought them right up.

655
00:53:20,021 --> 00:53:22,922
- Here you are. Thank you.
- Oh, thanks.

656
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,994
My picture's in the paper.
He recognized me.

657
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:30,587
We've got to go, quick.
We can't pack.

658
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:08,902
Listen.

659
00:54:09,004 --> 00:54:12,030
When you left the mountains,
you must have passed through New York.

660
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:15,473
Wherever you came from,
wherever you went, you must

661
00:54:15,577 --> 00:54:18,740
You must have heard Edwardes
ask for tickets to somewhere.

662
00:54:18,847 --> 00:54:20,872
I don't remember.

663
00:54:20,982 --> 00:54:23,883
You will. When you come
to the ticket window...

664
00:54:23,985 --> 00:54:26,647
try to relive that
other time with Edwardes.

665
00:54:26,755 --> 00:54:29,280
Try to repeat
what was said then.

666
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,416
Ask for the same tickets.

667
00:54:31,526 --> 00:54:33,426
I'll try.

668
00:54:42,037 --> 00:54:44,062
One. Philadelphia.

669
00:54:50,645 --> 00:54:55,446
<i>[Ticket Agent] Philadelphia. $3.39,</i>
<i>including the federal tax. Thank you.</i>

670
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:58,951
Washington, one way.

671
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,490
You went someplace with Edwardes.

672
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,787
Ask for tickets
to that same place.

673
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:08,362
<i>[Ticket Agent]</i>
<i>$8.46, including tax.</i>

674
00:55:08,463 --> 00:55:10,090
Thank you.

675
00:55:13,735 --> 00:55:16,795
What is it?

676
00:55:16,905 --> 00:55:20,306
What do you want, sir?

677
00:55:23,712 --> 00:55:25,976
Well, please step aside.

678
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:29,778
- I want two tickets.
<i>- Where to?</i>

679
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:38,281
- Rome. Rome.
<i>- To where?</i>

680
00:55:38,393 --> 00:55:41,658
- Rome.
- What Rome?

681
00:55:44,065 --> 00:55:46,260
He means Rome, Georgia.

682
00:55:56,177 --> 00:55:58,077
Is anything wrong?

683
00:55:58,179 --> 00:56:00,579
My husband is ill.
I'm taking him home.

684
00:56:00,682 --> 00:56:03,173
Here you are.
Two tickets to Rome, Georgia.

685
00:56:03,285 --> 00:56:05,947
He'll be all right in a minute.
These dizzy spells go away quickly.

686
00:56:06,054 --> 00:56:08,784
- He looks pretty sick.
I'll call a doctor.

687
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,983
Do you feel better now,
darling? Darling?

688
00:56:11,092 --> 00:56:13,856
Pull yourself together.
You're all right.

689
00:56:13,962 --> 00:56:15,953
When does the train
for Rome leave?

690
00:56:16,064 --> 00:56:19,090
<i>The Birmingham Special</i>
<i>leaves in ten minutes, track 17.</i>

691
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,794
- I feel better now.
- Thank you.

692
00:56:21,903 --> 00:56:25,134
That's all right, lady. I'll take you
to the train in case anything happens.

693
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,677
Oh, he has recovered now.
You're very nice to offer help,

694
00:56:50,732 --> 00:56:54,099
Act as if we are taking this train.
We'll walk down a ways

695
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,102
What's the matter
with this train?

696
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,104
The policeman heard us
buying the tickets.

697
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,174
- Did he act suspicious?
- No, he was very nice.

698
00:57:00,275 --> 00:57:02,675
But when he goes to the police
station tonight, he may find

699
00:57:02,777 --> 00:57:05,302
They'll telegraph Rome, Georgia,
and have us picked up.

700
00:57:05,413 --> 00:57:08,348
We can't go back to the hotel. They'll
have a million police there by now.

701
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:11,078
We're not going back.
We're going to Rochester.

702
00:57:11,186 --> 00:57:14,087
Come on. We'll go
over to Grand Central Station.

703
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:20,688
Oh, by the way, what are we
going to Rochester for?

704
00:57:20,795 --> 00:57:22,786
Oh, we're going
to visit Dr. Brulov.

705
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,161
Oh, that's the fellow
who doesn't like sauce bottles.

706
00:57:25,266 --> 00:57:28,133
- He was my analyst.
He psychoanalyzed me.

707
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:32,502
Oh, all analysts have to be
psychoanalyzed by other analysts

708
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:35,337
Ah, that's to make sure
that they're not too crazy.

709
00:57:35,443 --> 00:57:38,844
Apparently the mind is never too ill
to make jokes about psychoanalysis.

710
00:57:38,947 --> 00:57:42,474
- I'm sorry. I'm a pig.
- No, I am. I keep forgetting

711
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:46,076
So do I. When I hold you
like this, I feel entirely well.

712
00:57:46,187 --> 00:57:48,815
Will you love me just as much
when I'm normal?

713
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,391
Oh, I'll be insane about you.
[Laughing]

714
00:57:51,493 --> 00:57:53,688
I am normal.

715
00:57:55,363 --> 00:57:57,558
<i>At least there's nothing</i>
<i>wrong with me...</i>

716
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,998
that a nice long kiss
wouldn't cure.

717
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:02,968
Oh, I have never treated
a guilt complex that way before.

718
00:58:09,811 --> 00:58:13,406
- We don't want to attract attention.
- Everybody's doing it.

719
00:58:14,683 --> 00:58:16,810
[Laughs]

720
00:58:16,918 --> 00:58:21,184
- You're both going?
- Yes. Y-Yes.

721
00:58:28,863 --> 00:58:31,855
Oh, don't read the paper.
Let's pick up where we left off.

722
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:36,835
- Pick up what?
- Try to recall the first moment

723
00:58:36,938 --> 00:58:40,430
- Darling, I have
a confession to make.

724
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:43,272
As a doctor,
you irritate me.

725
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:45,846
I sit here swooning with love,
and then suddenly...

726
00:58:45,947 --> 00:58:48,609
you ask me a question
and I don't like you anymore.

727
00:58:48,717 --> 00:58:51,880
<i>Do you have to sit there</i>
<i>smiling at me like some smug,</i>

728
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,648
I can't help smiling.
That's what happens in analysis.

729
00:58:54,756 --> 00:58:57,782
As the doctor begins
to uncover the truth in a patient...

730
00:58:57,892 --> 00:59:01,328
said patient develops a fine,
hearty hatred of said doctor.

731
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:04,990
Well, you're going to hate me
a great deal before we're through.

732
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,092
- And you're going to like that?
- As a scientist, yes.

733
00:59:08,203 --> 00:59:11,570
And if I should happen to biff you one,
you'll consider that a sort of diploma?

734
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,198
Yes, but don't biff too hard.

735
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:16,971
You know, I think we should go on
with our investigation.

736
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:19,512
- We have some new facts
to work with now.

737
00:59:19,614 --> 00:59:21,980
You're a doctor,
you were in an accident...

738
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:24,176
your hand and forearm
were burned...

739
00:59:24,285 --> 00:59:27,482
- and you were in Rome.
- I was never in Rome in my life.

740
00:59:27,589 --> 00:59:29,853
You were either there
or going there.

741
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:33,086
<i>You remembered something no doubt</i>
<i>connected with the burning of your hand.</i>

742
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:37,187
Rome. Think of Rome.

743
00:59:37,298 --> 00:59:41,735
Maybe Rome, Italy.
When did you go to Rome?

744
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:44,669
<i>What did you do in Rome?</i>

745
00:59:44,773 --> 00:59:46,764
<i>Think.</i>

00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,109

[Mutters]

748
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:06,125
Yes, I remember. I remember something.
A fighter plane spotted us.

749
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:09,822
- You were flying?
- Transport, Medical Corps,

750
01:00:09,931 --> 01:00:14,061
<i>- What happened?</i>
- They hit us. Caught fire.

751
01:00:14,169 --> 01:00:16,069
What else?

752
01:00:17,472 --> 01:00:19,565
I don't know.
L-l-It blacks out.

753
01:00:19,674 --> 01:00:22,404
You left the army?

754
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:27,140
Yeah. I probably deserted it.
I hated it.

755
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,580
I hated killing.
I can remember that much.

756
01:00:29,684 --> 01:00:33,051
Your guilt fantasies were obviously
inflamed by your duties as a soldier.

757
01:00:34,155 --> 01:00:36,055
Oh, stop it.

758

01:00:42,397 --> 01:00:45,230
If there's anything I hate,
it's a smug woman.

761
01:00:48,203 --> 01:00:50,694
Darling, we're just beginning.

762
01:00:50,805 --> 01:00:52,830
Don't biff too hard yet.

763
01:01:03,518 --> 01:01:07,079
I worked as Dr. Brulov's assistant
for a year, right after my internship.

764
01:01:07,188 --> 01:01:09,748
He got me the post at Green Manors.
You'll like Alex.

765
01:01:09,858 --> 01:01:13,988
I doubt that. One psychoanalyst
in my hair is enough.

766
01:01:14,095 --> 01:01:17,724
- What are you gonna tell him?
- That we are on our honeymoon.

767
01:01:17,832 --> 01:01:21,427
Oh, Doctor, you think of
the most wonderful descriptions.

768
01:01:21,536 --> 01:01:23,800
Good evening.
Is Dr. Brulov in?

769
01:01:23,905 --> 01:01:27,033
No, he went out right after dinner.
He ought to be back soon.

770
01:01:29,344 --> 01:01:31,869
Would you mind telling him
I've left his supper on the table?

771
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,141
I'm sorry,
but I can't wait any longer.

772
01:01:34,249 --> 01:01:36,649
Oh, and there are two gentlemen
waiting for him in there.

773
01:01:44,192 --> 01:01:46,092
- How do you do?
<i>- [Man] How do you do?</i>

774
01:01:46,194 --> 01:01:48,094
How do you do?

775
01:02:01,576 --> 01:02:04,670
How's your mother been lately?

776
01:02:04,779 --> 01:02:07,873
Oh, she's still complaining
about rheumatism.

777
01:02:07,982 --> 01:02:11,145
She figures I ought to get
transferred down to Florida.

778
01:02:11,252 --> 01:02:14,813
I said, "Do you expect me to sacrifice
all chance of promotion...

779
01:02:14,923 --> 01:02:17,255
just because
you've got rheumatism?"

780
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,054
Did you take the subject up
with Hennessy?

781
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:23,221
Yeah. He said a transfer
could be arranged...

782
01:02:23,331 --> 01:02:25,822
but I'd probably have to start
all over again as a sergeant.

783
01:02:25,934 --> 01:02:28,334

<i>- Oh, a lot of things.</i>

01:02:33,975 --> 01:02:36,910
<i>He made some crack about me</i>

Oh, pardon me.
That may be for me.

790
01:02:46,955 --> 01:02:49,617
I gave Headquarters this number.

791
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:52,488
Hello.
Yes, this is Lieutenant Cooley.

792

<i>Any new developments?</i>

01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:58,356
<i>Well, when</i>
<i>did you find that out?</i>

794
01:02:58,466 --> 01:03:00,525
<i>No. Right. I'll be down later.</i>

795
01:03:00,635 --> 01:03:02,535
Good-bye.

- I just arrived.
- Imagine I find you here.

801
01:03:33,234 --> 01:03:35,464
Oh, I would have
come home quicker.

802
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:38,266
I was giving a lecture
at the army hospital.

803
01:03:38,373 --> 01:03:40,773
- Are these gentlemen with you?
- No, I'm here with...

804
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:43,708
<i>Dr. Brulov, I'm Lieutenant Cooley</i>
<i>of Central Station.</i>

805
01:03:43,811 --> 01:03:46,541
- This is Sergeant Gillespie.
- What for?

806
01:03:46,647 --> 01:03:49,377
We thought you might give us
some data on Dr. Edwardes.

807
01:03:49,484 --> 01:03:54,547
Data? What is this kind
of persecution?

808
01:03:54,655 --> 01:03:58,785
I told the policeman yesterday
I know nothing about Edwardes.

809
01:03:58,893 --> 01:04:01,794
But yesterday
you had some kind of theory.

810
01:04:01,896 --> 01:04:03,796
<i>[Brulov]</i>
<i>I explained to the policeman...</i>

811
01:04:03,898 --> 01:04:08,801
that if Edwardes took along with him
on vacation a paranoid patient...

812
01:04:08,903 --> 01:04:12,361
he was a bigger fool
than I ever knew he was.

813
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:15,169
<i>It is the same</i>
<i>as playing with a loaded gun.</i>

01:04:15,276 --> 01:04:17,506
<i>[Cooley] Do you think this</i>
<i>patient might have killed him?</i>

815
01:04:17,612 --> 01:04:20,012
I'm not thinking anything.
I am not a bloodhound.

816
01:04:20,114 --> 01:04:21,979
Was Dr. Edwardes
a great friend of yours?

817
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:25,246
What are you talking about?
The man was impossible.

818
01:04:25,353 --> 01:04:28,379
You had a quarrel with him when you
went back in New York, I understand.

819
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:31,925
Not New York. In Boston,
at the psychiatry convention.

820
01:04:32,026 --> 01:04:35,518
What kind of an analyst is it
who wants to cure psychosis...

821
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:39,498
by taking people skating
or to a bowling alley?

822
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,194
I understand you threatened
to punch his nose.

823
01:04:42,303 --> 01:04:45,272
All I did
was get up and walk out...

824
01:04:45,373 --> 01:04:48,240
and kick over a few chairs
which nobody was sitting in.

825
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:52,301
So you don't have to ask me any more
questions. You have now the facts.

826
01:04:52,413 --> 01:04:55,177
Well, thank you very much.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

If anything turns up,
we'll let you know.

- I got married.
- Uh, who is married?

834
01:05:23,244 --> 01:05:26,236
Oh, Alex.
My husband, John Brown.

835
01:05:26,347 --> 01:05:30,113
- I'm glad to meet you, officially.
- Oh, so you are married!

836
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:33,847
Oh, there is nothing so nice
as a new marriage.

837
01:05:33,955 --> 01:05:38,415
No psychosis yet, no regressions,
no guilt complexes.

838
01:05:38,526 --> 01:05:40,426
I congratulate you...

839
01:05:40,528 --> 01:05:44,760
and wish you have babies
and not phobias.

840

How about we have a glass
of beer like in the old days?

841
01:05:47,869 --> 01:05:50,565
Yes. The truth is
that we have no hotel room.

842
01:05:50,671 --> 01:05:54,004
- All the hotels were so crowded.
- What do you want with a hotel?

843
01:05:54,108 --> 01:05:57,839
That's for millionaires,
not lovebirds on a honeymoon.

844
01:05:57,945 --> 01:06:00,209
You will stay right here.

845
01:06:00,314 --> 01:06:04,045
Look how I'm living by myself
with a can opener.

846
01:06:04,152 --> 01:06:06,313
My housekeeper is gone to war.

847
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,615
My secretary is a WAC.

848
01:06:08,723 --> 01:06:12,489
And I got a cleaning woman
who can't cook and who hates me.

849
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:16,120
Cook me my coffee in the morning
and the house is yours.

850
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:20,064
- That's wonderful of you, Alex.
- Ah, there is nothing

851
01:06:20,168 --> 01:06:22,932
It's nice to see
my old assistant...

852
01:06:23,037 --> 01:06:26,768
the youngest
but the best one I ever had.

853
01:06:26,874 --> 01:06:29,274
But who knows now?

854
01:06:29,377 --> 01:06:32,778
As my old friend Zannenbaum
used to say...

855
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,782
"Women make
the best psychoanalysts...

till they fall in love.

857
01:06:38,986 --> 01:06:42,683
After that,
they make the best patients."

Good night, Dr. Brulov,

Any husband of Constance is
a husband of mine, so to speak.

- Good night, Alex.
- Good night.

864
01:07:14,355 --> 01:07:16,915
- You were superb with the police.
- Was I?

865
01:07:17,024 --> 01:07:19,959
Oh, carried it off
like a grade-A gun moll.

866
01:07:20,061 --> 01:07:23,895
Well, I felt terribly stupid for a few
minutes, but it turned out very well.

867
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,898
Providing the professor
isn't wiser than he seems.

868
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,266
Alex? Oh, no.
Things are a little different.

869
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:32,635
No, Alex didn't think anything.
He's sweet.

870
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:36,642
He may be sweet, but he didn't
even ask us where our bags were.

871
01:07:36,744 --> 01:07:40,805
Alex is always like that...
in a complete dream state, socially.

872
01:07:46,954 --> 01:07:50,151
Do you know,
this room does look changed.

873
01:07:50,258 --> 01:07:52,158
But it isn't.

874
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:56,128
It's I who am changed.
It's called transfer of affects.

875
01:07:56,230 --> 01:08:00,530
- What is?
- The fact that everything seems

876
01:08:00,635 --> 01:08:04,332
Oh. That's what it's called,
is it?

877
01:08:04,438 --> 01:08:07,407
- Did the police disturb you?
- Oh, no.

878
01:08:07,508 --> 01:08:10,204
One ignores such trifles
on a honeymoon.

879
01:08:12,146 --> 01:08:14,979
I take it
this is your first honeymoon.

880
01:08:15,082 --> 01:08:17,915
Yes. I mean...

881
01:08:18,019 --> 01:08:20,817
it would be if it were...

882
01:08:28,963 --> 01:08:31,124
For what it's worth, I...

883
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:35,134
I can't remember ever having
kissed any other woman before.

884
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:39,036
I have nothing to remember
of that, that nature either.

885
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,370
Oh, you're very sweet.

886
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,976
- Of course, I'm no child.
- Oh, far from it.

887
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:47,274
I'm well aware that we're all
bundles of inhibitions.

888
01:08:47,381 --> 01:08:49,406
Oh, dynamite dumps.

889
01:08:49,517 --> 01:08:51,417
No.

890
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:55,916
- Oh, please don't do that.
- Why?

891
01:08:56,023 --> 01:08:58,389
It isn't ethical.
I'm here as your doctor.

892
01:08:58,492 --> 01:09:01,120
Well, you can stop worrying, Doctor.
I'm gonna sleep on the couch.

893
01:09:01,228 --> 01:09:03,128
No, that's also unethical.

894
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:07,929
This honeymoon is complicated
enough without your dragging

895
01:09:08,035 --> 01:09:11,266
- I suppose the floor is out.
- The patient always sleeps in the bed.

896
01:09:11,372 --> 01:09:14,136
And the doctor occupies
the couch, fully dressed.

897
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:16,709
Oh, I see you know the rules.

898
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,650
- You remember something.
- No.

899
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:35,828
- This room reminds you of something.
- No.

900
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:38,228
You're resisting a memory.
What is in your mind?

901
01:09:38,332 --> 01:09:40,357
- I don't know.
- Yes you do! You're resisting it!

902
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:43,369
Don't start that again! Don't stand
there with that wiseacre look.

903
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:45,632
- I'm sick of your double-talk.
- You were looking at the bed.

904
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:49,870
What frightens you?
White lines.

905
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:54,038
When I made fork marks
on the tablecloth, they agitated you.

906
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,616
That night you kissed me,
you pushed me away because of my robe.

907
01:09:56,717 --> 01:09:58,776
It was white.
It had dark lines on it.

908
01:09:58,886 --> 01:10:01,514
Why does the color white frighten you?
Why do lines frighten you?

909
01:10:01,622 --> 01:10:04,250
- Think of white! White.
- 'Cause it frightens me. I can't look.

910
01:10:04,358 --> 01:10:08,260
Don't run away! Stand still!
Look at the white spread!

911
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:18,368
Darling.

912
01:10:18,472 --> 01:10:20,872
Oh, darling.

913
01:10:20,975 --> 01:10:23,239
You mustn't be frightened.

914
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:26,541
No, you mustn't.
We are making progress.

915
01:10:26,647 --> 01:10:29,912
We have the word white
on our side.

916
01:14:05,532 --> 01:14:08,968
Is that you, Mr. Brown?

917
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:12,561
Oh, I thought it was you.

918
01:14:12,673 --> 01:14:16,473
I was unable to sleep,
so I came down to work.

919
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:21,139
When you're old,
you don't need to sleep so much.

920
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:24,979
I'm just having a glass of milk
and some crackers.

921
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:28,919
Join me, please.
I'll get another glass.

922
01:14:29,023 --> 01:14:31,548
I'm glad to have company.

923
01:14:31,659 --> 01:14:36,255
Nobody likes to have crackers
and milk by himself.

924
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:41,726
When I was a young man,
I was always saying...

925
01:14:41,835 --> 01:14:45,362
<i>"Ah, if I could only</i>
<i>get along by myself...</i>

926
01:14:45,472 --> 01:14:47,997
<i>instead of wasting my time</i>
<i>with people...</i>

927
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:50,975
<i>I would be happy. "

928
01:14:51,078 --> 01:14:54,206
<i>Now I am saying just the opposite.</i>

929
01:14:54,314 --> 01:14:56,839
This is the secret of old age.

930
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:00,044
Everything becomes
just the opposite.

931
01:15:00,154 --> 01:15:02,918
Do you know who makes
the most trouble in the world?

932
01:15:03,023 --> 01:15:05,082
Old people.

933
01:15:05,192 --> 01:15:09,959
They are always worrying what is
going to be in the world tomorrow...

934
01:15:10,064 --> 01:15:12,794
after they are gone.

935
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,300
That's why they have wars...

936
01:15:15,402 --> 01:15:19,862
because old people got nothing
else they can get excited about.

937
01:15:23,877 --> 01:15:27,210
<i>Well... we will drink to you.</i>

938
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:32,217
To when we're young and know
nothing except living.

939
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,960
Alex!
Alex, are you all right?

940
01:16:17,064 --> 01:16:18,964
- Oh.
- [Sighs]

941
01:16:19,066 --> 01:16:23,560
Good morning.
Yes, I am all right. Thank you.

942
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:26,662
- Oh, I fell asleep in the chair.
- Yes.

943
01:16:26,774 --> 01:16:29,436
- What time is it?
- 7:00.

944
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:34,344
I was dreaming this morning
I get some real coffee.

945
01:16:34,448 --> 01:16:38,817
Yes. M-My husband must have gone out
very early this morning.

946
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:41,387
- You didn't happen...
<i>- He didn't go out.</i>

947
01:16:41,488 --> 01:16:44,423
<i>He's over there on the couch.</i>

948
01:16:44,525 --> 01:16:48,518
<i>He's all right.</i>
<i>He's sleeping fine.</i>

949
01:16:48,629 --> 01:16:53,623
My dear child,
do you think old Alex Brulov...

950
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,794
one of the biggest brains
who is in psychiatry...

951
01:16:56,904 --> 01:17:00,738
is unable to make out
two and two come out four?

952
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:05,303
[Sighs]
I should have known.

953
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:09,849
The moment I see you with a husband
whose pupils are enlarged...

954
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:12,282
who has a tremor
of the left hand...

955
01:17:12,386 --> 01:17:14,684
who is on a honeymoon
with no baggage...

956
01:17:14,788 --> 01:17:17,780
and whose name is John Brown...

957
01:17:17,891 --> 01:17:20,257
I know practically
what is going on.

958
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,260
What happened?

959
01:17:22,362 --> 01:17:26,594
Only what I expected.

960
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:31,433
There is no use taking chances
with a possibly dangerous case.

961
01:17:32,539 --> 01:17:34,507
I sit here waiting.

962
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,702
If you scream, I'm ready.

963
01:17:37,811 --> 01:17:41,076
So he comes downstairs,
and he's dangerous.

964
01:17:41,181 --> 01:17:43,411
I can see by his face.

965
01:17:43,517 --> 01:17:49,217
So I keep talking while I put
some bromide into a glass of milk...

966
01:17:49,323 --> 01:17:52,759
enough to knock out three horses.

967
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:56,489
When he falls down,
I run up to see you...

968
01:17:56,597 --> 01:17:58,497
you are sleeping like a baby...

969
01:17:58,599 --> 01:18:00,965
<i>and I come back here to watch out.</i>

970
01:18:02,536 --> 01:18:05,130
Well, the struggle against
his condition agitates him at times...

971
01:18:05,239 --> 01:18:07,139
but there is no danger in him.

972
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:12,440
This is what I found
in his hand last night.

973
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,479
He didn't know he had that.
Alex, you mustn't think that.

974
01:18:19,586 --> 01:18:21,645
He didn't try to do anything
to you. He couldn't.

975
01:18:21,755 --> 01:18:23,950
My dear child,
he's not responsible.

976
01:18:24,057 --> 01:18:26,924
But that's not correct.

977
01:18:27,027 --> 01:18:30,656
I'm just a little more experienced
with this type than you.

978
01:18:30,764 --> 01:18:33,528
I grant you know infinitely more
than I do, but in this ca...

979
01:18:33,634 --> 01:18:38,230
Do not complete this sentence with
the usual female contradictions!

980
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:40,431
You grant me
I know more than you...

981
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,667
but on the other hand
you know more than me.

982
01:18:42,776 --> 01:18:45,802
- Women's talk. Bah!
- Alex, what are you going to do?

983
01:18:45,913 --> 01:18:48,313
- Something more for you than for me.
- Alex.

984
01:18:48,415 --> 01:18:50,315
- I'm calling the police.
- No, no, please!

985
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:53,477
You are giving me orders.
My own pupil.

986
01:18:53,587 --> 01:18:55,817
You don't know this man.
You know only science.

987
01:18:55,923 --> 01:18:57,914
You know his mind,
but you don't know his heart.

988
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:01,085
We are speaking
of a schizophrenic...

989
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:03,162
and not a Valentine.

990
01:19:03,263 --> 01:19:05,993
We are speaking of a man.

991
01:19:06,099 --> 01:19:11,059
[Chuckling]
Oh. Oh, I see. Love.

992
01:19:13,507 --> 01:19:16,442
Look at you. Dr. Petersen...

993
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:22,277
the promising psychoanalyst,
is now all of a sudden a schoolgirl...

994
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:24,680
in love with an act,
nothing else.

995
01:19:24,785 --> 01:19:26,685
Alex, let me tell you about him.

996
01:19:26,787 --> 01:19:28,687
What is there for you to say?

997
01:19:28,789 --> 01:19:31,690
We both know that the mind
of a woman in love...

998
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:35,125
is operating on the lowest level
of the intellect.

999
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:39,187
The doctor told me not to smoke
in the morning, but I am too excited.

1000
01:19:40,968 --> 01:19:44,028
Oh, you are right.

1001
01:19:44,137 --> 01:19:46,537
I'm not an analyst,
not even a doctor here.

1002
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,870
I'm not talking to you as one.

1003
01:19:48,976 --> 01:19:51,877
But believe me...
not what I say, but what I feel.

1004
01:19:51,979 --> 01:19:54,470
The mind isn't everything.

1005
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:58,483
The heart
can see deeper sometimes.

1006
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:02,988
A police investigation might
ruin his chances for recovery,

1007
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,991
My dear, he killed Dr. Edwardes.
How can you help him?

1008
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:07,993
<i>He didn't. He didn't.</i>

1009
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:11,531
But if it turns out he did,
which I'm good and certain it will...

1010
01:20:11,631 --> 01:20:14,031
It won't. You yourself taught
me what Freud says...

1011
01:20:14,134 --> 01:20:17,194
"A man cannot do anything
in amnesia that his real

1012
01:20:17,304 --> 01:20:20,171
And how do you know
what his real character is?

1013
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:22,969
I know. I know.

1014
01:20:23,076 --> 01:20:25,203
She knows.

1015
01:20:25,312 --> 01:20:28,406
This is the way
science goes backward.

1016
01:20:28,515 --> 01:20:30,676
Who told you what he is?

1017
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:33,412
Freud... or a crystal ball?

1018
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,479
I couldn't feel this way
toward a man who was bad...

1019
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:39,752
or had committed murder.

1020
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:45,426
I couldn't feel this pain
for someone who was evil.

1021
01:20:45,532 --> 01:20:48,968
You are 20 times crazier than him.

1022
01:20:49,069 --> 01:20:52,596
[Mockingly]
She couldn't love him if he was no good.

1023
01:20:52,706 --> 01:20:55,140
This is baby talk, nothing else.

1024
01:20:55,242 --> 01:20:58,370
<i>What do you want I should do?</i>

1025
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:01,003
Give me time to treat him
and cure him...

1026
01:21:01,114 --> 01:21:04,345
before the police find him and shock
him into an incurable condition.

1027
01:21:04,451 --> 01:21:07,818
<i>- This could take a year.</i>
- Oh, no, no.

1028
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:10,185
Or a half a year.

1029
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:13,088
We should sit and hide
for a half a year...

1030
01:21:13,193 --> 01:21:16,287
waiting to find out if he's
going to cut your throat...

1031
01:21:16,396 --> 01:21:19,923
my throat and...
and set fire to the house.

1032
01:21:20,033 --> 01:21:22,092
Oh, my dear girl.

1033
01:21:22,202 --> 01:21:24,261
Even to a woman in love...

1034
01:21:24,371 --> 01:21:27,772
such a situation must seem
a little unreasonable.

1035
01:21:31,611 --> 01:21:34,637
Just a few more days, Alex,
before you turn him over.

1036
01:21:34,748 --> 01:21:38,149
Just a few more days.
And then if I can't do anything...

1037
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:41,414
if we both can't,
well, then you call the police.

1038
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:46,185
You're not hiding a criminal.
There is no evidence against him

1039
01:21:46,293 --> 01:21:50,161
He's wanted only as a possible witness
as to what happened to Dr. Edwardes.

1040
01:21:50,263 --> 01:21:52,595
Well, in his present condition,
he could tell the police nothing.

1041
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:55,532
Don't you see you are doing
nothing against the law?

1042
01:21:55,635 --> 01:21:59,401
We are helping them by investigating
the patient as doctors...

1043
01:21:59,506 --> 01:22:02,669
doctors who want the truth
even more than they do.

1044
01:22:06,613 --> 01:22:10,481
- All right.
- You'll wait?

1045
01:22:10,584 --> 01:22:12,677
Go make me coffee.

1046
01:22:12,786 --> 01:22:16,415
I'll pretend to myself I'm
acting sensible for a few days.

1047
01:22:18,091 --> 01:22:21,390
[Crying]
Oh, Alex.

1048
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:27,230
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1049
01:22:27,334 --> 01:22:29,825
Thank you.

1050
01:22:29,936 --> 01:22:34,930
It's, uh... I'll make you coffee...
with an egg in it.

1051
01:23:11,745 --> 01:23:14,543
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Brulov.

1052
01:23:14,648 --> 01:23:17,173
Brulov.
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1053
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:23,050
[Sighs] Bromides?
Who's been feeding me bromides?

1054
01:23:23,156 --> 01:23:26,751
I gave you... to sleep.

1055
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:30,523
Brulov.

1056
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:32,530
Oh, yes. Rochester.

1057
01:23:36,403 --> 01:23:38,496
- What's your name?
- [Sighs]

1058
01:23:39,906 --> 01:23:41,806
I don't know.

1059
01:23:45,946 --> 01:23:48,915
- Constance told you.
- Oh, nobody told me.

1060
01:23:49,015 --> 01:23:53,509
If I don't know a patient with amnesia
when I see one, what do I know?

1061
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:57,283
- You don't remember
your father or mother?

1062
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:59,517
- Wife or sweetheart?
- No!

1063
01:23:59,626 --> 01:24:03,027
Don't fight me.
I'm going to help you, if I can.

1064
01:24:04,231 --> 01:24:06,756
I'm going to be
your father image.

1065
01:24:06,866 --> 01:24:09,426
I want you to look on me
like your father.

1066
01:24:09,536 --> 01:24:12,869
Trust me, lean on me.

1067
01:24:12,973 --> 01:24:16,238
This is a shortcut,
but we haven't much time.

1068
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:18,641
All right.
Go ahead. I'm leaning.

1069
01:24:18,745 --> 01:24:21,305
Maybe you've got something
you want to tell me...

1070
01:24:21,414 --> 01:24:24,383
a single thought, a few words
in the corner of your head?

1071
01:24:24,484 --> 01:24:26,384
Go on. Talk to me.

1072
01:24:26,486 --> 01:24:30,616
Whatever comes into your head,
just say what it is.

1073
01:24:30,724 --> 01:24:34,820
- There's nothing.
- Maybe you dreamt something.

1074
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:40,897
- Yeah.
- What did you dream?

1075
01:24:41,001 --> 01:24:44,528
I don't believe in dreams.
That Freud stuff's a lot of hooey.

1076
01:24:44,638 --> 01:24:48,267
Hooey?
You are a fine one to talk.

1077
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:51,572
You've got amnesia,
and you've got a guilt complex.

1078
01:24:51,678 --> 01:24:55,546
You don't know if you're coming
or going from someplace.

1079
01:24:55,649 --> 01:24:59,210
But Freud is hooey.
This you know.

1080
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:01,913
[Scoffs]
Wise guy.

1081
01:25:02,022 --> 01:25:03,922
[Sighing]

1082
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:09,720
You don't like me, Papa.

1083
01:25:09,829 --> 01:25:12,821
You want I should help you...
or not?

1084
01:25:14,701 --> 01:25:16,635
[Chuckles]
I'm sorry.

1085
01:25:18,805 --> 01:25:21,205
I'll explain to you
about dreams...

1086
01:25:21,308 --> 01:25:24,334
so you don't think it is hooey.

1087
01:25:24,444 --> 01:25:28,904
The secrets of who you are and what
has made you run away from yourself...

1088
01:25:29,015 --> 01:25:32,314
all these secrets
are buried in your brain...

1089
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:35,217
but you don't want
to look at them.

1090
01:25:35,322 --> 01:25:38,689
The human being very often doesn't
want to know the truth about himself...

1091
01:25:38,792 --> 01:25:41,283
because he thinks
it will make him sick.

1092
01:25:41,394 --> 01:25:45,660
So he makes himself sicker,
trying to forget.

1093
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:48,029
- Do you follow this?
- Yeah.

1094
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:53,032
- Oh, how do you feel?
- Ah, coffee.

1095
01:25:53,139 --> 01:25:55,505
Awful.

1096
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:59,066
The patient is going to tell us
what he dreamt.

1097
01:25:59,179 --> 01:26:02,307
Oh, fine. I'll take notes.
I'll get my glasses.

1098
01:26:03,516 --> 01:26:06,713
Now, here's where dreams
come in.

1099
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:11,086
They tell you
what you are trying to hide...

1100
01:26:11,191 --> 01:26:13,682
but they tell it to you
all mixed up...

1101
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:16,921
like pieces of a puzzle
that don't fit.

1102
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:19,498
The problem
of the analyst is...

1103
01:26:19,599 --> 01:26:21,658
to examine this puzzle...

1104
01:26:21,768 --> 01:26:24,931
and put the pieces together
in the right place...

1105
01:26:25,038 --> 01:26:29,407
and find out what the devil you
are trying to say to yourself.

1106
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,614
Let's see.

1107
01:26:35,715 --> 01:26:39,378
I kept thinking while I was dreaming
that all this meant something...

1108
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:42,546
that there was some other meaning
in it that I ought to find out.

1109
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:44,555
We'll find out.

1110
01:26:50,764 --> 01:26:54,359
I can't make out just
what sort of a place it was.

1111
01:27:03,143 --> 01:27:06,169
<i>It seemed to be a gambling house.</i>

1112
01:27:06,279 --> 01:27:10,739
<i>But there weren't any walls, just a lot</i>
<i>of curtains with eyes painted on them.</i>

1113
01:27:12,786 --> 01:27:17,780
<i>A man was walking around</i>
<i>with a large pair of scissors</i>

1114
01:27:22,796 --> 01:27:25,321
<i>And then a girl came in</i>
<i>with hardly anything on...</i>

1115
01:27:25,432 --> 01:27:28,765
<i>and started walking around</i>
<i>the gambling room kissing everybody.</i>

1116
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:31,632
<i>She came to my table first.</i>

1117
01:27:31,738 --> 01:27:36,038
<i>[Brulov]</i>
<i>Did you recognize this kissing bug?</i>

1118
01:27:36,142 --> 01:27:39,805
Well, I'm afraid she looked
a little like Constance.

1119
01:27:39,913 --> 01:27:43,576
<i>Uh-huh. This is plain,</i>
<i>ordinary, wishful dreaming.</i>

1120
01:27:43,683 --> 01:27:45,583
<i>- Go on.</i>
- [Chuckles] Well...

1121
01:27:45,685 --> 01:27:50,247
I was sitting there playing cards
with a man who had a beard.

1122
01:27:50,356 --> 01:27:53,757
<i>I was dealing to him.</i>
<i>I turned up the seven of clubs.</i>

1123
01:27:57,464 --> 01:28:00,763
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"That makes 21. I win."</i>

1124
01:28:00,867 --> 01:28:02,801
<i>When he turned up his cards,</i>
<i>they were blank.</i>

1125
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:05,769
<i>Just then the proprietor came in</i>
<i>and accused him of cheating.</i>

1126
01:28:05,872 --> 01:28:10,172
<i>The proprietor yelled,</i>
<i>"This is my place and if I catch you</i>

1127
01:28:13,313 --> 01:28:15,508
I'm sorry
about that kissing bit.

1128
01:28:15,615 --> 01:28:19,244
I'm glad you didn't dream of me as
an eggbeater as one of my patients did.

1129
01:28:19,352 --> 01:28:22,583
- Why? What would that mean?
- Never mind.

1130
01:28:22,689 --> 01:28:25,157
Well, does it make any sense
to you what I dreamed?

1131
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:27,522
Not yet. You are trying
to tell yourself something.

1132
01:28:27,627 --> 01:28:30,596
What it is
we'll figure out later.

1133
01:28:30,697 --> 01:28:32,892
There's a lot more to it.

1134
01:28:32,999 --> 01:28:36,093
Go on and try
to recall the details.

1135
01:28:36,202 --> 01:28:40,002
The more cockeyed the better
for the scientific side of it.

1136
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:47,371
He was leaning over the sloping
roof of a high building.

1137
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,041
<i>It was the man with the beard.</i>
<i>I yelled at him to watch out.</i>

1138
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:55,746
<i>But then he went over, slowly,</i>
<i>with his feet in the air.</i>

1139
01:28:55,855 --> 01:28:59,347
<i>And then I saw the proprietor</i>
<i>again... the man in the mask.</i>

1140
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:03,828
<i>He was hiding behind a tall chimney</i>
<i>and he had a small wheel in his hand.</i>

1141
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:10,000
<i>I saw him drop the wheel</i>
<i>on the roof.</i>

1142
01:29:17,377 --> 01:29:20,642
<i>Suddenly I was running. Then I heard</i>
<i>something beating over my head.</i>

1143
01:29:20,747 --> 01:29:23,545
<i>It was a great pair of wings.</i>
<i>The wings chased me...</i>

1144
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:26,881
<i>and almost caught up with me</i>
<i>when I came to the bottom of the hill.</i>

1145
01:29:29,422 --> 01:29:31,982
[Chuckles] I must have escaped.
I don't remember.

1146
01:29:33,693 --> 01:29:36,253
That's all there was.
I woke up and saw Dr. Brulov.

1147
01:29:36,362 --> 01:29:38,455
- Have some coffee.
- Thanks.

1148
01:29:47,974 --> 01:29:51,307
- Something's happening.
- What is it?

1149
01:29:57,283 --> 01:29:59,945
- Snow.
- The light frightened him.

1150
01:30:00,053 --> 01:30:02,578
Photophobia.

1151
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:04,589
No, it was the snow.

1152
01:30:24,077 --> 01:30:26,978
That's the white he's afraid of.

1153
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,980
Snow and those tracks.

1154
01:30:29,082 --> 01:30:32,711
- What tracks?
- The sled tracks in the snow.

1155
01:30:32,819 --> 01:30:37,779
The first symptom he revealed
was shock at the sight of fork

1156
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:39,824
And my robe.
It had dark lines on it.

1157
01:30:39,926 --> 01:30:42,019
And last night,
the white coverlet...

1158
01:30:42,128 --> 01:30:44,653
like those dark tracks
in the snow.

1159
01:30:44,764 --> 01:30:47,597
We'll pull the blinds down,
please.

1160
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:49,998
Dr. Edwardes was fond of sports.

1161
01:30:50,103 --> 01:30:52,970
He mentions tennis and skiing
in his book as valuable...

1162
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:55,370
in the treatment
of mental disorders.

1163
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:59,575
Skiing.

1164
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:01,840
Ski tracks in the snow.

1165
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:06,613
That's what those dark lines
symbolized for him.

1166
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:10,621
His horror at them means that
they are immediately connected

1167
01:31:10,723 --> 01:31:13,248
Yes, a murder on skis.

1168
01:31:24,203 --> 01:31:27,730
Where did Edwardes go for his skiing?
We must find out.

1169
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,206
Can you tell us where? Try.

1170
01:31:30,309 --> 01:31:33,472
He has told us of it,
in his dream.

1171
01:31:33,579 --> 01:31:36,275
Let me see your notes.

1172
01:31:37,517 --> 01:31:39,417
What can we do for him?

1173
01:31:39,519 --> 01:31:42,079
Oh, you're not his mama.
You're an analyst.

1174
01:31:42,188 --> 01:31:45,954
Leave him alone.
He will come out of this by himself.

1175
01:31:46,059 --> 01:31:48,789
The sloping roof.

1176
01:31:48,895 --> 01:31:50,954
That means only a mountainside.

1177
01:31:51,064 --> 01:31:52,964
And they were skiing.

1178
01:31:53,066 --> 01:31:56,001
And the father image...
the bearded man... is Dr. Edwardes.

1179
01:31:56,102 --> 01:31:59,868
That's very simple. Dr. Edwardes
plunged over the precipice while skiing.

1180
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:04,306
And then a shadow chases him
up and down a hill.

1181
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:07,038
That could mean he was escaping
from a valley.

1182
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:10,980
Skiing resorts are often called
valleys, like, like Sun Valley.

1183
01:32:11,084 --> 01:32:15,077
He was being pursued by a winged
figure... a witch or a harpy.

1184
01:32:15,188 --> 01:32:17,679
No, the figure was you.

1185
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:22,022
If you grew wings,
you would be an angel.

1186
01:32:22,128 --> 01:32:24,790
The dream's trying to tell him
the name of the resort.

1187
01:32:24,897 --> 01:32:28,663
Angel. Angel Valley.

1188
01:32:28,768 --> 01:32:33,000
Do you remember Angel Valley?

1189
01:32:33,106 --> 01:32:37,099
- No.
- We could call a travel agency

1190
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:39,701
It wasn't Angel Valley.

1191
01:32:41,547 --> 01:32:43,708
I remember it.

1192
01:32:43,816 --> 01:32:47,775
It was a place...
called Gabriel Valley.

1193
01:32:47,887 --> 01:32:49,787
What else do you remember now?

1194
01:32:49,889 --> 01:32:52,653
Who was the masked figure
in your dream?

1195
01:32:52,759 --> 01:32:55,193
It was an accident. Do you remember
that? A skiing accident.

1196
01:32:55,294 --> 01:32:57,728
- Dr. Edwardes went over a snow cliff.
- It was no accident!

1197
01:32:57,830 --> 01:33:01,061
I can't stand this anymore!
I've had enough of it.

1198
01:33:02,335 --> 01:33:04,530
No, we have to go
to Gabriel Valley.

1199
01:33:04,637 --> 01:33:06,537
You've got to go with me.

1200
01:33:09,509 --> 01:33:11,807
This is for Cooley
when he comes in.

1201
01:33:11,911 --> 01:33:13,811
I'll tell him.

I can't go on endangering you.

01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:33,590
- I know about last night.
- Nothing happened.

1208
01:33:33,699 --> 01:33:36,532
But it will. I've got to end it
before it does.

1209

I love you,
but I'm not worth loving.

Darling,
you can help me afterward.

1211

There's no help afterward.
If you give yourself up

1212
01:33:45,444 --> 01:33:47,344
there is no afterwards
for either of us.

1213
01:33:47,446 --> 01:33:50,074
- I can cure you.
- But you can't undo a murder.

1214
01:33:50,183 --> 01:33:52,083
- There is none to undo.
- I killed him.

Don't try to stop me.
I've got to go.

1217
01:33:56,455 --> 01:33:59,390
Guilt, guilt. You've lived with it
for a long time, haven't you?

1218
01:33:59,492 --> 01:34:01,392
- Yes.
<i>- Since childhood.</i>

1219
01:34:01,494 --> 01:34:05,123
- What?
- Ever since childhood, you've

1220
01:34:05,231 --> 01:34:08,064
You've always felt guilty about
anything that happened around you.

1221
01:34:08,167 --> 01:34:10,226
What was it in your youth?
It must have been terrible...

1222
01:34:10,336 --> 01:34:13,828
for you to prefer to think
you murdered Edwardes rather

1223
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:17,034
- Enough!
- You said you love me.

1224
01:34:17,143 --> 01:34:19,771
Look at me then.
Why am I fighting for you?

1225
01:34:19,879 --> 01:34:22,439
- Because I love you.
Because I need you.

1226
01:34:22,548 --> 01:34:25,073
- I want you to come with me
to Gabriel Valley.

1227
01:34:25,184 --> 01:34:28,119
When you see the hill where the accident
happened, you will remember it.

1228
01:34:28,221 --> 01:34:30,849
- We'll go skiing together
as you did with Edwardes.

1229
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:33,152
You'll see your innocence.
You'll see what really happened.

1230
01:34:33,259 --> 01:34:35,159
You mean,
because it will happen again.

1231
01:34:35,261 --> 01:34:37,161
- Yes.
- And what if I killed him?

<i>[Stair Creaks]</i>

1233

<i>I'm likely to do the same</i>
<i>thing I did before?</i>

Then how do you know
I won't kill again?

1236
01:34:52,044 --> 01:34:54,342
Because I'm convinced you didn't
kill in the first place.

1237
01:34:56,782 --> 01:34:59,649
You believe in me enough
to take such a chance?

1238
01:34:59,752 --> 01:35:03,552
Of course I do.
We are going back to that ski run.

1239
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:07,285
We'll find out
what it was in your childhood

And we'll also find out
what happened to Dr. Edwardes.

You ever see her before?

Let's go.

1243
01:35:42,228 --> 01:35:46,597
I've always loved very feminine clothes
but never quite dared to wear them.

1244
01:35:50,202 --> 01:35:55,196
But I'm going to, after this.
I'm going to wear exactly

1245
01:35:55,308 --> 01:35:57,208
and you.

1246
01:36:05,952 --> 01:36:08,921
Even very, very funny hats.

1247
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:13,821
You know, the kind that
make you look a little drunk.

01:38:28,094 --> 01:38:30,289
<i>[J.B. 's Voice]</i>
<i>It</i> was <i>something in my childhood.</i>

1251
01:38:30,396 --> 01:38:32,762
<i>Something in my childhood!</i>

1252
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:35,095
<i>I remember now!</i>
<i>I killed my brother!</i>

1253
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:50,674
I didn't kill my brother. It was
an accident. It was an accident!

1254
01:38:50,783 --> 01:38:54,446
That's what has haunted you all
your life. That was the memory

1255
01:39:17,977 --> 01:39:20,844
It's like looking into
a picture book... an old one.

1256
01:39:20,946 --> 01:39:23,437
Seeing the familiar pictures,
one at a time.

1257
01:39:23,549 --> 01:39:25,983
I went to Columbia Medical School.

1258
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:30,954
I had a girl with a giggle who,
luckily, married my roommate Ken.

1259
01:39:31,056 --> 01:39:34,287
Oh, and by the way,
my name's John Ballyntine.

1260
01:39:34,393 --> 01:39:36,327
Oh, I'm very pleased
to meet you.

1261
01:39:36,428 --> 01:39:38,953
Another thing.
My, my army record's all right.

1262
01:39:39,064 --> 01:39:40,964
I was invalided out.

1263
01:39:41,066 --> 01:39:43,626
I ran into Dr. Edwardes when
I was in the Cumberland Mountains...

1264
01:39:43,736 --> 01:39:47,797
trying to recover
from some kind of nerve shock

1265
01:39:47,907 --> 01:39:50,307
He was on vacation,
but I asked him to help me.

1266
01:39:50,409 --> 01:39:52,309
And he invited me
to go skiing with him.

1267
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:56,643
We went through New York, and I seem
to remember going to lunch somewhere.

1268
01:39:56,749 --> 01:39:59,411
I'm still a little bit vague
about that lunch part.

1269
01:39:59,518 --> 01:40:03,852
Then we arrived here, and
the accident happened at that spot.

1270
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,856
Where you saved me.

1271
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:09,860
Now, let's not have any
confusion about who saved whom.

1272
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:11,862
Yes, he went over there,
all right.

1273
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:14,558
It's still a little foggy,
but I do know...

1274
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:17,033
that Edwardes was about 50 feet
ahead of me when he went over.

1275
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:19,900
- I saw him plunge.
- That was the thing that set you off...

1276
01:40:20,005 --> 01:40:21,905
that stirred up
your old guilt complex...

1277
01:40:22,007 --> 01:40:23,907
and made you think
that you'd killed him.

1278
01:40:24,009 --> 01:40:27,410
So you had to run away from that
too, and you took on the role

1279
01:40:27,513 --> 01:40:29,413
to prove to yourself
that he wasn't dead.

1280
01:40:29,515 --> 01:40:31,779
So, therefore,
you had not killed him.

1281
01:40:31,884 --> 01:40:36,514
Professor, I never quite realized
in my amnesic state how lovely you are.

1282
01:40:36,622 --> 01:40:40,353
Oh, now that you got your head back,
you mustn't lose it again.

1283
01:40:40,459 --> 01:40:44,122
Oh, no. It's too late.
I'm beyond cure.

1284
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:46,596
How does it feel
to be a great analyst?

1285
01:40:46,699 --> 01:40:49,429
- Oh, not so bad.
- And a great detective.

1286
01:40:49,535 --> 01:40:54,063
- Wonderful.
- And madly adored?

1287
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:56,664
Very wonderful.

1288
01:40:56,775 --> 01:40:59,608
You'll look wonderful...
in white...

1289
01:40:59,712 --> 01:41:03,443
with a little orange blossom
in your hair.

1290
01:41:03,549 --> 01:41:06,780
That, that sounds vaguely as if it
has something to do with marriage.

1291
01:41:06,885 --> 01:41:09,877
That's a brilliant analysis,
Doctor.

1292
01:41:09,989 --> 01:41:12,753
- Oh.
<i>- [Door Opens]</i>

1293
01:41:14,093 --> 01:41:15,993
<i>[J.B.]</i>
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

1294
01:41:16,095 --> 01:41:19,030
You know Lieutenant Cooley
and Sergeant Gillespie from Rochester.

1295
01:41:19,131 --> 01:41:21,031
<i>Yes, yes.</i>
<i>We know them quite well.</i>

1296
01:41:21,133 --> 01:41:23,863
- How did you find us?
- Well, no thanks

1297
01:41:23,969 --> 01:41:26,233
We made a few inquiries
at the railroad station.

1298
01:41:26,338 --> 01:41:29,535
- You left a trail a mile wide.
- Well, you arrived

1299
01:41:29,642 --> 01:41:31,610
I believe
that's the usual expression.

1300
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:36,773
We found the body of Dr. Edwardes.
It's almost exactly...

1301
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:39,077
<i>where you told the local police</i>
<i>it would be.</i>

1302
01:41:39,184 --> 01:41:41,084
<i>You remembered the spot</i>
<i>very well.</i>

1303
01:41:41,186 --> 01:41:45,316
- Well, thank goodness
it's all cleared up.

1304
01:41:45,424 --> 01:41:47,619
I'm afraid a bullet was found
in the body.

1305
01:41:52,931 --> 01:41:55,399
T-T-That's impossible.

1306
01:41:55,501 --> 01:41:58,402
- It was in his back.
- The case is one of murder.

1307
01:42:00,539 --> 01:42:02,439
<i>We shall have to detain you, sir.</i>

1308
01:42:02,541 --> 01:42:06,443
<i>It's my duty to inform you that anything</i>
<i>you say may be used against you.</i>

1309
01:42:14,053 --> 01:42:16,419
No. No, you mustn't say
you killed him, darling.

1310
01:42:16,522 --> 01:42:19,719
Try to remember what happened
before Edwardes went over.

1311
01:42:19,825 --> 01:42:22,385
But when he said he killed him,
he wasn't himself.

1312
01:42:22,494 --> 01:42:25,054
He was in a state
of great mental distress.

1313
01:42:25,164 --> 01:42:27,189
But you can't put him away.
You can't!

1314
01:42:27,299 --> 01:42:30,029
It'll destroy his mind!
Don't you understand?

1315
01:42:31,203 --> 01:42:33,933
Good-bye, my dear.

1316
01:42:34,039 --> 01:42:38,442
We won't give up hope. I'm going
to fight and fight and get you free.

1317
01:42:46,085 --> 01:42:51,819
My dear girl, you cannot keep
bumping your head against reality...

1318
01:42:51,924 --> 01:42:54,518
and saying it is not there.

1319
01:42:54,626 --> 01:42:56,958
The evidence was definite.

1320
01:42:57,062 --> 01:43:00,156
We can't remove it
by wishing or crying.

1321
01:43:02,634 --> 01:43:04,534
He trusted me.

1322
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:07,036
I led him into a trap.
I convicted him.

1323
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:10,240
Is that real enough for you?

1324
01:43:10,342 --> 01:43:13,539
There is no one to blame.

1325
01:43:13,645 --> 01:43:17,581
The case was a little deeper
than you figured.

1326
01:43:17,683 --> 01:43:21,915
This often happens.
You must realize now one thing.

1327
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:24,386
It is over for both of you.

1328
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:26,924
It's not over.

1329
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:30,153
<i>- You will have other cases.</i>
- It's not over. It never will be!

1330
01:43:30,262 --> 01:43:33,663
Don't ask me to stop.
I can't! I can't. [Sobbing]

1331
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:40,668
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

1332
01:43:40,773 --> 01:43:43,833
I, l...

1333
01:43:45,611 --> 01:43:51,447
Thanks for straightening things out
with Dr. Murchison and everyone.

1334
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,715
It is very sad...

1335
01:44:00,826 --> 01:44:04,193
to love and lose somebody.

1336
01:44:04,296 --> 01:44:06,856
But in a while, you will forget...

1337
01:44:06,965 --> 01:44:09,900
and you will take up
the threads of your life...

1338
01:44:10,002 --> 01:44:12,869
where you left off not so long ago.

1339
01:44:12,971 --> 01:44:15,337
And you will work hard.

1340
01:44:15,441 --> 01:44:18,535
There is lots of happiness
in working hard.

1341
01:44:18,644 --> 01:44:20,612
Maybe the most.

1342
01:44:23,849 --> 01:44:25,749
I will write to you.

1343
01:44:29,254 --> 01:44:33,714
Oh, Alex, you're very good.

1344
01:44:33,826 --> 01:44:37,057
- Very good.
<i>- [Knock At Door]</i>

1345
01:44:37,162 --> 01:44:41,098
I'm sorry to hurry you, Dr. Brulov,
but your car is waiting.

1346
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:44,397
- You have just time.
- Oh, thank you.

1347
01:44:44,503 --> 01:44:47,131
I'm always late,
always forgetting.

1348
01:45:18,136 --> 01:45:20,161
A brilliant man.

1349
01:45:20,272 --> 01:45:22,502
I should have gone
to the station with him.

1350
01:45:22,608 --> 01:45:27,136
You're too tired. I know that
feeling of exhaustion only too well.

1351
01:45:27,246 --> 01:45:30,272
One must humor it,
or it explodes.

1352
01:45:30,382 --> 01:45:33,613
I shall try to help you,
in every way.

1353
01:45:33,719 --> 01:45:36,779
- You will take care of yourself?
- Yes.

1354
01:45:36,889 --> 01:45:39,551
And try to forget things
better forgotten.

1355
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,521
You've got a great career
ahead of you, Constance.

1356
01:45:43,629 --> 01:45:46,689
Thank you. Well, at least
one good thing came out of all this.

1357
01:45:46,798 --> 01:45:48,857
You are back at Green Manors.

1358
01:45:48,967 --> 01:45:52,095
Who knows what would have happened
to the place under Dr. Edwardes?

1359
01:45:52,204 --> 01:45:54,900
I knew Edwardes only slightly.

1360
01:45:55,007 --> 01:45:57,441
I never really liked him.

1361
01:45:57,543 --> 01:46:01,775
But he was a good man,
in a way, I suppose.

1362
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:04,474
Well, good night, Constance.

1363
01:46:04,583 --> 01:46:06,983
I hope you feel rested
in the morning.

1364

Come in.

1375
01:47:54,459 --> 01:47:56,450
I want to talk to you,
Dr. Murchison.

1376
01:47:56,561 --> 01:48:00,361
It's rather late.
I do need rest, Constance.

1377
01:48:00,465 --> 01:48:02,433
I must talk to you.

1378
01:48:02,534 --> 01:48:05,196
<i>Nocturnal conferences</i>
<i>are bad for the nerves.</i>

1379
01:48:05,303 --> 01:48:07,533
- Is it something about your work?
- Yes.

1380
01:48:07,639 --> 01:48:10,335
- Can't it wait till morning?
- It can't wait.

1381
01:48:10,442 --> 01:48:12,342
Well, do sit down.

1382
01:48:15,414 --> 01:48:19,009
Now, what's your problem?

1383
01:48:19,117 --> 01:48:22,314
It is a dream
one of my patients reported.

1384
01:48:22,421 --> 01:48:24,321
May I ask who the patient is?

1385
01:48:25,524 --> 01:48:27,458
The patient is John Ballyntine.

1386
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,085
I fancied that.

1387
01:48:31,196 --> 01:48:34,097
And you're still working
on the possibility of his innocence.

1388
01:48:34,199 --> 01:48:36,099
Charming loyalty...

1389
01:48:36,201 --> 01:48:38,999
one of your most attractive
characteristics, Constance.

1390
01:48:39,104 --> 01:48:41,334
[Sighs]
What did he dream?

1391
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,670
He dreamt
he was in a gambling house.

1392
01:48:43,775 --> 01:48:46,676
It was full of odd people
playing with blank cards.

1393
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,710
Blank cards.

1394
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:53,649
Obviously, the patient was trying
to deny it was a gambling house...

1395
01:48:53,752 --> 01:48:55,652
by dreaming of spurious cards.

1396
01:48:55,754 --> 01:48:59,451
One of the people in the place
went around cutting the drapes in half.

1397
01:48:59,558 --> 01:49:03,187
Another was a scantily dressed
girl who was kissing everybody.

1398
01:49:03,295 --> 01:49:06,662
With a little effort, one could almost
imagine them inmates of Green Manors.

1399
01:49:06,765 --> 01:49:09,256
That's what I had in mind,
Dr. Murchison.

1400
01:49:11,036 --> 01:49:13,266
Interesting notion
to play around with, isn't it?

1401
01:49:13,371 --> 01:49:15,271
Do go on.

1402
01:49:16,742 --> 01:49:20,576
There were eyes painted
on the curtains around the walls.

1403
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:23,546
Oh. The guards at Green Manors.

1404
01:49:24,883 --> 01:49:28,478
The patient was playing cards,
now no longer blank...

1405
01:49:28,587 --> 01:49:31,886
a game of 21 with a bearded man
who was evidently Dr. Edwardes.

1406
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:36,017
Yes, one usually dreams of one's
analyst as an authority with a beard.

1407
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:39,291
He dealt Edwardes the seven
of clubs, and Edwardes said...

1408
01:49:39,397 --> 01:49:41,888
"That makes it 21."

1409
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,800
I would say the patient
was trying to mention a locale.

1410
01:49:45,904 --> 01:49:48,498
The seven of clubs
might mean a club.

1411
01:49:48,607 --> 01:49:51,167
Yes, with the word 21 in it.

1412
01:49:51,276 --> 01:49:54,336
There is such a place in New York.
It's called the 21 Club.

1413
01:49:54,446 --> 01:49:55,913
I've heard of it.

1414
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:04,048
The patient dreamt
the proprietor of the place came in...

1415
01:50:04,156 --> 01:50:06,420
and began accusing
Dr. Edwardes of cheating.

1416
01:50:06,525 --> 01:50:09,494
He ordered Edwardes out and said,
"I won't allow you to play here.

1417
01:50:09,594 --> 01:50:12,062
This is my place.
I'm going to fix you."

1418
01:50:12,164 --> 01:50:15,998
The dream gives the locale
a double identity...

1419
01:50:16,101 --> 01:50:18,467
the 21 Club and Green Manors.

1420
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:21,971
But the proprietor seems
to belong more to the latter.

1421
01:50:23,141 --> 01:50:25,371
In fact...

1422
01:50:25,477 --> 01:50:28,241
I would say that
this angry proprietor...

1423
01:50:28,346 --> 01:50:32,544
who threatened Dr. Edwardes...
was myself.

1424
01:50:35,053 --> 01:50:37,681
It seemed that way to me.

1425
01:50:41,326 --> 01:50:45,490
I presume you only arrived
at this solution tonight.

1426
01:50:45,597 --> 01:50:47,690
<i>Yes.</i>

1427
01:50:47,799 --> 01:50:51,200
And have confided your
psychoanalytic findings to nobody.

1428
01:50:51,303 --> 01:50:53,203
Not yet.

1429
01:50:57,175 --> 01:50:59,075
Was there any more
to the dream?

1430
01:50:59,177 --> 01:51:03,307
Yes. The patient dreamt he
and Dr. Edwardes...

1431
01:51:03,415 --> 01:51:06,009
were on a high-sloping roof...

1432
01:51:06,117 --> 01:51:08,847
and that he saw Edwardes plunge
over the edge to his death.

1433
01:51:08,954 --> 01:51:12,446
He also saw the angry proprietor
hiding behind the chimney, laughing...

1434
01:51:12,557 --> 01:51:14,457
holding a small wheel
in his hand.

1435
01:51:14,559 --> 01:51:17,289
He dropped the wheel.

1436
01:51:17,395 --> 01:51:20,262
The symbolism of the small wheel
escapes me.

1437
01:51:22,767 --> 01:51:25,793
It was a revolver.

1438
01:51:25,904 --> 01:51:29,067
The proprietor who threatened
Edwardes' life in the 21 Club...

1439
01:51:29,174 --> 01:51:35,044
dropped a revolver in the snow
in Gabriel Valley after shooting

1440
01:51:35,146 --> 01:51:37,979
The weapon is still there
at the foot of a tree...

1441
01:51:38,083 --> 01:51:40,278
with the murderer's
fingerprints on it.

1442
01:51:40,385 --> 01:51:44,287
I can't agree with this part
of your interpretation...

1443
01:51:44,389 --> 01:51:47,654
for the good reason that
the weapon is now in my hand.

1444
01:51:50,295 --> 01:51:52,627
I imagined something
of this sort would happen...

1445
01:51:52,731 --> 01:51:55,097
when I made the slip tonight
about knowing Edwardes.

1446
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,828
That started your agile
young mind going.

1447
01:51:57,936 --> 01:52:00,928
You were having a breakdown.

1448
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:05,806
And in a state of panic, you heard that
Edwardes was to take your place here.

1449
01:52:05,911 --> 01:52:10,712
So you sought him out in his
favorite restaurant where he was

1450
01:52:10,815 --> 01:52:14,046
You accused him
of stealing your job.

1451
01:52:14,152 --> 01:52:16,347
You threatened to kill him.

1452
01:52:16,454 --> 01:52:20,356
He calmed you down, told you he
was off on a skiing vacation.

1453
01:52:20,458 --> 01:52:25,760
You followed him there...
and shot him from behind a tree.

1454
01:52:25,864 --> 01:52:28,560
That's enough.
Your story is ridiculous.

1455
01:52:28,667 --> 01:52:30,567
You'll make a fool of yourself...

1456
01:52:30,669 --> 01:52:33,194
a love-smitten analyst
playing a dream detective.

1457
01:52:33,305 --> 01:52:36,706
There'll be no dreams
for the police.

1458
01:52:36,808 --> 01:52:40,505
They'll find out from the waitress
in the 21 Club that you were there.

1459
01:52:40,612 --> 01:52:45,743
You'll be identified as the man
who had a row with Dr. Edwardes.

1460
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:50,446
There'll be people who saw you
on the train to Gabriel Valley,

1461
01:52:50,555 --> 01:52:54,218
There will be no dreams
necessary for this case.

1462
01:52:55,794 --> 01:52:57,694
I see.

1463
01:52:59,731 --> 01:53:04,600
You're an excellent analyst,
Dr. Petersen, but a rather stupid woman.

1464
01:53:04,703 --> 01:53:09,106
What did you think I'd do when you
told me all this? Congratulate you?

1465
01:53:10,875 --> 01:53:14,811
You forget in your imbecilic
devotion to your patient...

1466
01:53:14,913 --> 01:53:17,905
that the punishment
for two murders...

1467
01:53:18,016 --> 01:53:19,916
is the same as for one.

1468
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:26,020
You're not going to commit
a second murder, Dr. Murchison.

1469
01:53:26,124 --> 01:53:28,718
I hadn't planned to.

1470
01:53:28,827 --> 01:53:32,786
But you're here.
You're not leaving.

1471
01:53:34,366 --> 01:53:38,860
A man with your intelligence
does not commit a stupid murder.

1472
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:44,067
You're thinking you're not
mentally responsible for that

1473
01:53:44,175 --> 01:53:47,872
They'll find extenuating circumstances
in the state of your health.

1474
01:53:47,979 --> 01:53:51,881
They'll not execute you
for the death of Dr. Edwardes.

1475
01:53:51,983 --> 01:53:56,647
You can still live,
read, write, research...

1476
01:53:56,755 --> 01:53:59,315
even if you are put away.

1477
01:53:59,424 --> 01:54:03,292
You're thinking that now,
Dr. Murchison.

1478
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:11,635
If you shoot now,
it is cold, deliberate murder.

1479
01:54:11,736 --> 01:54:14,728
You'll be tried
as a sane murderer...

1480
01:54:14,839 --> 01:54:17,569
convicted as a sane man...

1481
01:54:17,675 --> 01:54:20,872
and killed in the electric chair
for your crime.

1482
01:54:20,979 --> 01:54:24,710
I'm going to telephone
the police now, Dr. Murchison.

1483
01:54:42,667 --> 01:54:44,726
[Laughing]
And remember what I say.

1484
01:54:45,437 --> 01:54:49,464
Any husband of Constance
is a husband of mine, so to speak.

1485
01:54:49,574 --> 01:54:52,907
- All right. Good-bye. Good luck.
- Good-bye.
